Introduction
Foryears, doctors and engineers have work edtomak eartificial limbs, such asthis hand forpeople who need them. This
particular product isdiffer ent, however, because itwas developed using a3Dprinter. Asaresult, itcan beprinted much
likeyou print wordsonasheet ofpaper. This mak esproducing thelimb less expensive and faster than conventional
methods.
Biomedical engineers areworking todevelop organs that may one daysave lives. Scientists atNASA aredesigning ways to
use3Dprinters tobuild onthemoon orMars. Already, animals arebenefitting from3D-printed parts, including atortoise
shell and a dog leg. Builders have e ven constructed entir e buildings using a 3D printer.
The technology and use of3Dprinters depend ontheability tounderstand thelanguage ofalgebr a.Engineers must

Find Factors, Prime Factorizations, and Least Common Multiples
The numbers 2,4,6,8,10,12arecalled multiples of2.Amultiple of2canbewritten astheproduct ofacounting number
and 2.
Similarly, a multiple of 3 would be the pr oduct of a counting number and 3.
We could find the multiples of any number b y continuing this pr ocess.

Multiple of a Number
A number is a multiple ofnif it is the pr oduct of a counting number and n.
Another way tosaythat 15isamultiple of3istosaythat 15isdivisible by3.That means that when wedivide 3into 15,
we get a counting number. In fact, 15÷3is 5, so 15 is 5·3.
Divisible by a Number
If a number mis a multiple of n, then misdivisible byn.
Ifweweretolook forpatterns inthemultiples ofthenumbers 2through 9,wewould disco verthefollo wing divisibility
tests:
Divisibility Tests
A number is divisible b y:
2 if the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
3 if the sum of the digits is divisible b y3.
5 if the last digit is 5 or 0.
6 if it is divisible b y both 2 and 3.
10 if it ends with 0.

Solution
ⓐ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 2?
Does it end in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8? No.
5,625 is no t divisible b y 2.
ⓑ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 3?
What is t he sum of t he digits? 5+6+2+5=18
Is the sum divisible b y 3? Yes.
5,625 is divisible b y 3.
ⓒ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 5 or 10?
What is t he las t digit? It is 5. 5,625 is divisible b y 5 but no t by 10.
ⓓ
Is 5,625 divisible b y 6?
Is it divisible b y both 2 and 3? No, 5,625 is no t divisible b y 2, so 5,625 is
not divisible b y 6.

TRY IT : : 1.2Is 3,765 divisible b yⓐ2?ⓑ3?ⓒ5?ⓓ6?ⓔ10?
Inmathematics, ther eareoften severalways totalk about thesame ideas. Sofar,we’ve seen that ifmisamultiple ofn,
wecansaythat misdivisible byn.Forexample, since 72isamultiple of8,wesay72isdivisible by8.Since 72isamultiple
of 9, we say 72 is divisible b y 9. W e can e xpress this still another way.
Since 8·9=72,we say that 8 and 9 ar efactors of 72. When we write 72=8·9,we say we have factor ed 72.
Other ways tofactor 72are1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and 6·12.The number 72has many factors:
1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,and 72.
Factors
Ifa·b=m,then aand barefactors ofm.
Some numbers, such as72,have many factors. Other numbers have only two factors. Aprime number isacounting
number gr eater than 1 whose only factors ar e 1 and itself.
Prime number and Composite number
Aprime number is a counting number gr eater than 1 whose only factors ar e 1 and the number itself.
Acomposite number isacounting number that isnotprime. Acomposite number has factors other than 1and the
number itself.Chapter 1 Foundations 7The counting numbers from2to20arelisted inthetable with their factors. Mak esuretoagreewith the“prime” or
“composite” label for each!
The prime numbers less than 20 ar e 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only e ven prime number is 2.
Acomposite number canbewritten asaunique product ofprimes. This iscalled theprime factorization ofthenumber.
Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will be useful in many topics in this course.
Prime Factorization
The prime factorization of a number is the pr oduct of prime numbers that equals the number.
Tofind theprime factorization ofacomposite number, find any two factors ofthenumber and use them tocreate two
branches. Ifafactor isprime, that branch iscomplete. Circlethat prime. Otherwise itiseasy tolose trackoftheprime
numbers.
Ifthefactor isnotprime, find two factors ofthenumber and continue theprocess. Once allthebranches have circled
primes atthe end, the factorization iscomplete. The composite number can nowbewritten asaproduct ofprime
numbers.

Least Common Multiple
The least common multiple (L CM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
Tofind theleast common multiple oftwo numbers wewillusethePrime Factors Method. Let’s find theLCMof12and 18
using their prime factors.
EXAMPLE 1.3 HOW TO FIND THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE USING THE PRIME FACTORS METHOD
Find the least common multiple (L CM) of 12 and 18 using the prime factors method.
Solution
HOW TO : : FIND THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF A COMPOSITE NUMBER.
Find two factors whose product isthegiven number, and use these numbers tocreate two
branches.
If a factor is prime, that br anch is complete. Cir cle the prime, lik e a leaf on the tr ee.
If a factor is not prime, write it as the pr oduct of two factors and continue the pr ocess.
Write the composite number as the pr oduct of all the cir cled primes.
Step 1.
Step 2.
Step 3.
Step 4.Chapter 1 Foundations 9Notice that theprime factors of12(2·2·3)and theprime factors of18(2·3·3)areincluded intheLCM (2·2·3·3).
So 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18.
Bymatching upthecommon primes, each common prime factor isused only once. This way you aresurethat 36isthe
least common multiple.

Use V ariables and Algebr aic Symbols
Inalgebr a,weuse aletter ofthealphabet torepresent anumber whose value may change. Wecallthis avariable and
letters commonly used for variables ar ex,y,a,b,c.
Variable
Avariable is a letter that r epresents a number whose value may change.
A number whose value always r emains the same is called a constant .
Constant
Aconstant is a number whose value always stays the same.
Towrite algebr aically, weneed some oper ation symbols aswell asnumbers and variables. Ther eareseveraltypes of
symbols wewillbeusing. Ther earefour basic arithmetic oper ations: addition, subtr action, multiplication, and division.
We’ll list the symbols used to indicate these oper ations belo w.
Operation Symbols
Oper ation Notation Say: The r esult is…
Addition a+b aplus b the sum of aand b
Subtr action a−b aminus b the differ ence of aand b
Multiplication a·b,ab,(a)(b),
(a)b,a(b)atimes b the pr oduct of aand b
Division a÷b,a/b,a

By not using an equal sign when you simplify an e xpression, you may avoid confusing e xpressions with equations.
Simplify an Expression
Tosimplify an e xpression , do all oper ations in the e xpression.
We’ve introduced most ofthesymbols and notation used inalgebr a,butnowweneed toclarify theorderofoper ations .
Otherwise, e xpressions may have differ ent meanings, and the y may r esult in differ ent values.
For example, consider the expression 4+3·7.Some students simplify this getting 49,byadding 4+3and then
multiplying that r esult b y 7. Others get 25, b y multiplying 3·7first and then adding 4.
The same expression should give thesame result. Somathematicians established some guidelines that arecalled the
order of oper ations.
Students often ask, “HowwillIremember theorder?” Hereisaway tohelp you remember: Takethefirst letter ofeach
key wor d and substitute the silly phr ase “Please Ex cuse My Dear Aunt Sally”.

Identify and Combine Lik e Terms
Algebr aicexpressions aremade upofterms. Aterm isaconstant, ortheproduct ofaconstant and one ormor evariables.
Term
Aterm is a constant or the pr oduct of a constant and one or mor e variables.
Examples of terms ar e7,y,5x2,9a,and b5.
The constant that multiplies the variable is called the coefficient .
Coefficient
The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.
Think ofthecoefficient asthenumber infrontofthevariable. The coefficient oftheterm 3xis3.When wewrite x,the
coefficient is 1, since x=1·x.
Some terms shar ecommon traits. When two terms areconstants orhave thesame variable and exponent, wesaythey
arelike terms .
Look at the follo wing 6 terms. Which ones seem to have tr aits in common?
5x7n243x9n2
We say,

5xand 3xare like terms.
n2and 9n2are like terms.
Like Terms
Terms that ar e either constants or have the same variables r aised to the same po wers ar e called like terms.

The no tation −ais read as “t he opposite of a.”
Wesaw that numbers such as3and −3 areopposites because theyarethesame distance from0onthenumber line.
Theyareboth threeunits from0.The distance between 0and anynumber onthenumber lineiscalled theabsolute value
of that number.
Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance fr om 0 on the number line.24 Chapter 1 Foundations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5The absolute value of a number nis written as |n|and |n|≥0for all numbers.
Absolute values ar e always gr eater than or equal to zer o.
For e xample,
−5is 5 units a way from 0, so |−5|=5.
5 is 5 units a way from 0, so |5|=5.
Figur e 1.4 illustr ates this idea.
Figur e 1.4 The numbers 5 and −5 are 5 units
away fr om 0.
The absolute value ofanumber isnevernegative because distance cannot benegative. The only number with absolute
value equal to zer o is the number zer o itself because the distance fr om 0 to 0 on the number line is zer o units.
In the ne xt example, we’ll or der e xpressions with absolute values.

Most students arecomfortable with the addition and subtr action facts forpositive numbers. But doing addition or
subtr action with both positive and negative numbers may be mor e challenging.
Wewilluse two color counters tomodel addition and subtr action ofnegatives sothat you can visualize theprocedur es
instead of memorizing the rules.
We let one color (blue) r epresent positive. The other color (r ed) will r epresent the negatives.
Ifwehave one positive counter and one negative counter, thevalue ofthepair iszero.Theyform aneutr alpair. The value
of this neutr al pair is zer o.26 Chapter 1 Foundations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5We will use the counters to sho w ho w to add:
5+3 −5+(−3) −5+3 5+(−3)
The first e xample, 5+3,adds 5 positives and 3 positives—both positives.
The second e xample, −5+(−3),adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives—both negatives.
When thesigns arethesame, thecounters areallthesame color, and soweadd them. Ineach case weget8—either 8
positives or 8 negatives.
So what happens when the signs ar e differ ent? Let’s add −5+3and 5+(−3).
When weuse counters tomodel addition ofpositive and negative integers, itiseasy tosee whether ther earemor e
positive or mor e negative counters. So we kno w whether the sum will be positive or negative.
EXAMPLE 1.14
Add: ⓐ−1+(−4)ⓑ−1+5ⓒ1+(−5).
Solution
ⓐ
1 negative plus 4 negatives is 5 negatives
ⓑ
Ther e are mor e positives, so the sum is positive.

TRY IT : : 1.27Add: ⓐ−2+(−4)ⓑ−2+4ⓒ2+(−4).
TRY IT : : 1.28Add: ⓐ−2+(−5)ⓑ−2+5ⓒ2+(−5).
Wewillcontinue tousecounters tomodel thesubtr action. Perhaps when you wereyounger, you read “5−3”as“5take
away 3.” When you use counters, you can think of subtr action the same way!
We will use the counters to sho w to subtr act:
5−3 −5−(−3) −5−3 5−(−3)
The first e xample, 5−3,we subtr act 3 positives fr om 5 positives and end up with 2 positives.
In the second e xample, −5−(−3),we subtr act 3 negatives fr om 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.
Each e xample used counters of only one color, and the “tak e away” model of subtr action was easy to apply.
What happens when wehave tosubtr actone positive and one negative number? We’llneed touse both blue and red
counters aswell assome neutr alpairs. Ifwedon’t have thenumber ofcounters needed totakeaway, weadd neutr al
pairs. Adding aneutr alpair does notchange thevalue. Itislikechanging quarters tonickels—the value isthesame, but
it looks differ ent.
Let’s look at −5−3and 5−(−3).

Multiply and Divide Integers
Since multiplication ismathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our model can easily beapplied toshow
multiplication ofintegers. Let’s look atthis concr etemodel toseewhat patterns wenotice. Wewillusethesame examples
that we used for addition and subtr action. Her e, we ar e using the model just to help us disco ver the pattern.
We remember that a·bmeans add a,btimes .
The nexttwo examples aremor einter esting. What does itmean tomultiply 5by−3?Itmeans subtr act 5,3times.
Looking atsubtr action as“taking away”, itmeans totakeaway 5,3times. Butther eisnothing totakeaway, sowestart
by adding neutr al pairs on the workspace.
In summary:
5·3=15 −5(3)=−15
5(−3)=−15 (−5)(−3)=15
Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the
signs ar e thesame , the pr oduct is positiv e.
signs ar ediffer ent, the pr oduct is negative.
What about division? Division istheinverse oper ation ofmultiplication. So, 15÷3=5because 5·3=15.Inwords,
this expression says that 15canbedivided into 3groups of5each because adding fivethreetimes gives 15.Ifyou look at
some e xamples of multiplying integers, you might figur e out the rules for dividing integers.Chapter 1 Foundations 315·3=15so15÷3=5−5(3)=−15so−15÷3=−5
(−5)(−3)=15so15÷(−3)=−55(−3)=−15so−15÷(−3)=5
Division follo ws the same rules as multiplication with r egar d to signs.
Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
For multiplication and division of two signed numbers:
Same signs Result
•Two positives Positive
•Two negatives Positive
If the signs ar e the same, the r esult is positive.
Differ ent signs Result
•Positive and negative Negative
•Negative and positive Negative
If the signs ar e differ ent, the r esult is negative.

To add or subtr act fr actions, add or subtr act the numer ators and place the r esult o ver the common denominator.
The least common denominator (LCD) oftwo fractions isthe smallest number that can beused asacommon
denominator of the fr actions. The L CD of the two fr actions is the least common multiple (L CM) of their denominators.
Least Common Denominator
The least common denominator (LCD) of two fr actions is the least common multiple (L CM) of their denominators.
After wefind theleast common denominator oftwo fractions, weconvert thefractions toequivalent fractions with the
LCD. Putting these steps together allo ws us to add and subtr act fr actions because their denominators will be the same!

Remember that when anumber nismultiplied byitself, wewrite n2and read it“nsquar ed.” The result iscalled the
squar eofanumber n.Forexample, 82isread “8squar ed” and 64iscalled thesquar eof8.Similarly, 121isthesquar e

Ifn2=m,then mis the squar eofn.
What about thesquar esofnegative numbers? Weknowthat when thesigns oftwo numbers arethesame, their product
is positive. So the squar e of any negative number is also positive.
(−3)2=9 (−8)2=64 (−11 )2=121 (−15 )2=225
Because 102=100,wesay100isthesquar eof10.Wealso saythat 10isasquar erootof100. Anumber whose squar e

Square Root of a Number
Ifn2=m,then nis asquar e rootofm.
Notice (−10 )2=100 also, so−10 isalso asquar erootof100. Ther efore,both 10and −10 aresquar eroots of100. So,
every positive number has two squar eroots—one positive and one negative. The radical sign, m,denotes thepositive
squar eroot. The positive squar erootiscalled theprincipal squar eroot.When weusetheradical sign that always means
we want the principal squar e root.
Square Root Notation
mis read “the squar e root of m.”
Ifm=n2,then m=n,forn≥0.
The squar e root of m,m,is the positive number whose squar e ism.

Identify Integers, Rational Numbers, Irr ational Numbers, and Real Numbers
Wehave already described numbers ascounting number s,whole number s,and integers .What isthediffer ence between
these types ofnumbers? Differ ence could beconfused with subtr action. Howabout asking howwedistinguish between
these types of numbers?
Counting numbers 1,2,3,4,…..
Whole numbers 0,1,2,3,4,….
Integ ers ….−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,….
What type ofnumbers would wegetifwestarted with alltheintegers and then included allthefractions? The numbers
wewould have form thesetofrational numbers. Arational number isanumber that can bewritten asaratio oftwo
integers.
Ingener al,any decimal that ends after anumber ofdigits (such as7.3or−1.2684 )isarational number. Wecan use
theplace value ofthelast digit asthedenominator when writing thedecimal asafraction. The decimal for1

number 0.3–
.The baroverthe3indicates that thenumber 3repeats infinitely. Continuously hasanimportant meaning
in calculus. The number(s) under the bar is called the r epeating block and it r epeats continuously.
Since allintegers can bewritten asafraction whose denominator is1,theintegers (and soalso thecounting and whole
numbers. ar e rational numbers.
Every rational number canbewritten both asaratio ofintegersp
q,wher epand qareintegers and q≠0,and asadecimal
that stops or r epeats.
Rational Number
Arational number is a number of the formp
q,wher epand qare integers and q≠0.
Its decimal form stops or r epeats.
Arether eany decimals that donotstop orrepeat? Yes!The number π(the Greek letter pi,pronounced “pie”), which is
very important indescribing circles, has adecimal form that does notstop orrepeat. Weuse threedots (…)toindicate
the decimal does not stop or r epeat.
π=3.141592654 ...
The squar e root of a number that is not a perfect squar e is a decimal that does not stop or r epeat.
Anumbers whose decimal form does not stop orrepeat cannot bewritten asafraction ofintegers. Wecall this an
irrational number .
Irrational Number
Anirrational number is a number that cannot be written as the r atio of two integers.
Its decimal form does not stop and does not r epeat.
Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is r ational or irr ational.
Rational or Irrational
If the decimal form of a number
•repeats or stops , the number is a rational number .
•does not r epeat and does not stop , the number is an irrational number.Chapter 1 Foundations 65Wehave seen that allcounting numbers arewhole numbers, allwhole numbers areintegers, and allintegers arerational
numbers. The irrational numbers arenumbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When weput
together the r ational numbers and the irr ational numbers, we get the set of real number s.
Real Number
Areal number is a number that is either r ational or irr ational.
Later inthis course wewillintroduce numbers beyond therealnumbers. Figur e1.7illustr ates howthenumber sets we’ve
used so far fit together.
Figur e 1.7 This chart sho ws the number sets that
mak e up the set of r eal numbers.
Does theterm “realnumbers” seem strange toyou? Arether eanynumbers that arenot“real,” and, ifso,what could they
be? Can we simplify −25 ?Is ther e a number whose squar e is −25 ?
()2=−25 ?
None ofthenumbers that wehave dealt with sofarhas asquar ethat is−25 .Why? Any positive number squar edis
positive. Any negative number squar edispositive. Sowesayther eisnorealnumber equal to −25 .The squar erootof
a negative number is not a r eal number.

Amor ethor ough introduction tothetopics coveredinthis section canbefound intheElementary Algebra chapter,
Foundations.
Use the Commutative and Associative Pr operties
The orderweadd two numbers doesn’t affect theresult. Ifweadd 8+9or9+8,theresults arethesame—the yboth
equal 17. So, 8+9=9+8.The or der in which we add does not matter!
Similarly, when multiplying two numbers, theorderdoes notaffect theresult. Ifwemultiply 9·8or8·9theresults are
the same—the y both equal 72. So, 9·8=8·9.The or der in which we multiply does not matter!
These e xamples illustr ate the Commutative Pr operty .
Commutative Property
of Addition Ifaand bare real numbers, t hen a+b=b+a.
of Multiplication Ifaand bare real numbers, t hen a·b=b·a.
When adding or multiplying, changing the ordergives the same r esult.
The Commutative Property has todowith order. Wesubtr act 9−8and 8−9,and see that 9−8≠8−9.Since
changing the or der of the subtr action does not give the same r esult, we kno w that subtraction is not commutative .
Division isnotcommutative either .Since 12÷3≠3÷12,changing theorderofthedivision didnotgive thesame result.
The commutative pr operties apply only to addition and multiplication!
Addition and multiplication arecommutative.
Subtr action and division ar enotcommutative.
When adding threenumbers, changing the grouping ofthe numbers gives the same result. For example,
(7+8)+2=7+(8+2),since each side of the equation equals 17.
This is true for multiplication, too. For e xample,⎛
⎝5·1
3⎞
⎠·3=5·⎛
⎝1
3·3⎞
⎠,since each side of the equation equals 5.
These e xamples illustr ate the Associative Pr operty .
Associative Property
of Addition Ifa,b,and care real numbers, t hen (a+b)+c=a+(b+c).
of Multiplication Ifa,b,and care real numbers, t hen (a·b)·c=a·(b·c).
When adding or multiplying, changing the grouping gives the same r esult.
The Associative Property hastodowith grouping. Ifwechange howthenumbers aregrouped, theresult willbethesame.
Notice it is the same thr ee numbers in the same or der—the only differ ence is the gr ouping.
We saw that subtr action and division wer e not commutative. The y are not associative either.

The Identity Property ofaddition says that when weadd 0toany number, theresult isthat same number. What happens
when we multiply a number b y 0? Multiplying b y 0 mak es the pr oduct equal zer o.
What about division involving zero?What is0÷3?Think about arealexample: Ifther earenocookies inthecookie jar

gets 0 cookies. So, 0÷3=0.
We can check division with the r elated multiplication fact. So we kno w0÷3=0because 0·3=0.

Simplify Expr essions Using the Distributive Pr operty
Suppose that threefriends aregoing tothemovies. Theyeach need $9.25—that’s 9dollars and 1quarter—to payfortheir
tickets. Ho w much mone y do the y need all together?
Youcan think about thedollars separ ately fromthequarters. Theyneed 3times $9so$27 and 3times 1quarter, so75
cents. In total, the y need $27.75. If you think about doing the math in this way, you ar e using the Distributive Pr operty.
Distributive Property
Ifa,b,and care real numbers, t hen a(b+c)=ab+ac
(b+c)a=ba+ca
a(b−c)=ab−ac
(b−c)a=ba−ca
In algebr a, we use the Distributive Pr operty to r emo ve par entheses as we simplify e xpressions.

The absolute value of a number is its distance fr om 0on the number line.
The number 0 is the additive identity because adding 0 to any number does not change its value.
The opposite of a number is its additive inverse.
The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term.
A fraction in which the numer ator or the denominator is a fr action is called a comple x fraction.

Terms that ar e either constants or have the same variables r aised to the same po wers ar e called lik e terms.
A number is a multiple of nif it is the pr oduct of a counting number and n.
The number 1isthe multiplicative identity because multiplying 1byany number does not
change its value.
The r ecipr ocal of a number is its multiplicative inverse.
Numbers less than 0are negative numbers.

A per cent is a r atio whose denominator is 100.
The prime factorization of a number is the pr oduct of prime numbers that equals the number.
A prime number is a counting number gr eater than 1 whose only factors ar e 1 and the number itself.
The positive squar e root is called the principal squar e root.

Solve Coin W ord Pr oblems
Using algebr atofind thenumber ofnickelsand pennies inapiggy bank may seem silly. Youmay wonder why wejust
don’t open thebank and count them. Butthis type ofproblem introduces ustosome techniques that willbeuseful aswe
move forwar d in our study of mathematics.
Ifwehave apile ofdimes, howwould wedetermine itsvalue? Ifwecount thenumber ofdimes, we’ll knowhowmany
wehave—the number ofdimes. Butthis does nottellusthevalue ofallthedimes. Saywecounted 23dimes, howmuch
aretheyworth? Each dime isworth $0.10—that isthevalue ofone dime. Tofind thetotal value ofthepile of23dimes,
multiply 23 b y $0.10 to get $2.30.
The number of dimes times the value of each dime equals the total value of the dimes.
number·value=totalvalue
23·$0.10 =$2.30
This method leads to the follo wing model.
Total Value of Coins
For the same type of coin, the total value of a number of coins is found b y using the model
number·value=totalvalue
•number is the number of coins
•value is the value of each coin
•total value is the total value of all the coins
Ifwehad severaltypes ofcoins, wecould continue this process foreach type ofcoin, and then wewould knowthetotal
value of each type of coin. T o get the total value of allthe coins, add the total value of each type of coin.

Solution
Step 1. Read the pr oblem. Mak e sur e all the wor ds and ideas ar e understood.
•Draw a diagr am to illustr ate what it happening. Belo w sho ws a sk etch of what is happening in the e xample.
•Create a table to or ganize the information.
◦Label the columns r ate, time, distance.
◦List the two scenarios.
◦Write in the information you kno w.Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations 157Step 2. Identify what we ar e looking for.
We are ask ed to find the aver age speeds of Carina and her br other.
Step 3. Name what we ar e looking for. Choose a variable to r epresent that quantity.
•Complete the chart.
•Use variable e xpressions to r epresent that quantity in each r ow.
Wearelooking fortheir aver age speeds. Let’s letrrepresent theaver age speed ofCarina. Since thebrother’s
speed is 15 mph faster, we r epresent that as r+15.
Fill in the speeds into the chart.
•Multiply the r ate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. T ranslate into an equation.
•Restate the pr oblem in one sentence with all the important information.
•Then, tr anslate the sentence into an equation.
Again, weneed toidentify arelationship between thedistances inordertowrite anequation. Look atthediagr am
wecreated aboveand notice therelationship between thedistance Carina traveled and thedistance herbrother
traveled.
The distance Carina tr aveled plus the distance her br other tr avel must add up to 410 miles. So we write:
Step 5. Solve the equation using algebr a techniques.
Now solve this equation.
So Carina’s br other's speed was 50 mph.
Carina’s speed is r+15.
Her br other’s speed was 65 mph.
Step 6. Check the answer in the pr oblem and mak e sur e it mak es sense.
Carina dr ove65mph(3hours )= 195 miles
Her br other dr ove50mph(4hours )= 200 miles—————
395 miles ✓

west. The truck traveling west travels at70mph and thetruck traveling east has anaver age speed of60mph. Howlong
will the y travel befor e the y are 325 miles apart?
Solution
Step 1. Read the pr oblem. Mak e all the wor ds and ideas ar e understood.
•Draw a diagr am to illustr ate what it happening.
•Create a table to or ganize the information.
◦Label the columns r ate, time, distance.
◦List the two scenarios.
◦Write in the information you kno w.
Step 2. Identify what we ar e looking for.
We are ask ed to find the amount of time the trucks will tr avel until the y are 325 miles apart.
Step 3. Name what we ar e looking for. Choose a variable to r epresent that quantity.
•Complete the chart.
•Use variable e xpressions to r epresent that quantity in each r ow.
We are looking for the time tr avelled. Both trucks will tr avel the same amount of time.
Let’s call the time t. Since their speeds ar e differ ent, the y will tr avel differ ent distances.
•Multiply the r ate times the time to get the distance.
Step 4. T ranslate into an equation.Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations 159•Restate the pr oblem in one sentence with all the important information.
•Then, tr anslate the sentence into an equation.
Weneed tofind arelation between thedistances inordertowrite anequation. Looking atthediagr am, what is
the r elationship between the distances each of the trucks will tr avel?
The distance travelled bythetruck going west plus thedistance travelled bythetruck going east must add upto
325 miles. So we write:
Step 5. Solve the equation using algebr a techniques.
Now sol ve this eq uation 70t+60t=325
130t=325
t=2.5
So it will tak e the trucks 2.5 hours to be 325 miles apart.
Step 6. Check the answer in the pr oblem and mak e sur e it mak es sense.

Solution
First, we dr aw a diagr am that r epresents the situation to help us see what is happening.160 Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Weareaskedtofind herspeed walking and riding herbike.Let’s callherwalking speed r.Since herbiking speed isthree
miles per hour faster, we will call that speed r+3.We write the speeds in the chart.
The speed isinmiles per hour, soweneed toexpressthetimes inhours, too, inorder fortheunits tobethesame.
Remember, 1 hour is 60 minutes. So:
30 minutes is30
60or1
2hour
15 minutes is15
60or1
4hour
We write the times in the chart.
Next, we multiply r ate times time to fill in the distance column.
The equation will come fromthefact that thedistance fromNaok o’shome toher school isthesame whether she is

Solve Linear Inequalities
Alinear inequality ismuch likealinear equation—but the equal sign isreplaced with aninequality sign. Alinear170 Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5inequality isaninequality inone variable that can bewritten inone ofthe forms, ax+b<c,ax+b≤c,
ax+b>c,orax+b≥c.
Linear Inequality
Alinear inequality isaninequality inone variable that can bewritten inone ofthefollo wing forms wher ea,b,and c
are real numbers and a≠0:
ax+b<c, ax+b≤c, ax+b>c, ax+b≥c.
When wesolved linear equations, wewereable tousetheproperties ofequality toadd, subtr act,multiply, ordivide both
sides and still k eep the equality. Similar pr operties hold true for inequalities.
We can add or subtr act the same quantity fr om both sides of an inequality and still k eep the inequality. For e xample:
Notice that the inequality sign stayed the same.
This leads us to the Addition and Subtr action Pr operties of Inequality.
Addition and Subtraction Property of Inequality
For any numbers a,b, and c,ifa<b,then
a+c<b+c a−c<b−c
a+c>b+c a−c>b−c
We can add or subtr act the same quantity fr om both sides of an inequality and still k eep the inequality.
What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides b y a constant?
Let’s first multiply and divide both sides b y a positive number.
The inequality signs stayed the same.
Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply b y a negative number?
Notice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs r eversed their dir ection.
When wedivide ormultiply aninequality byapositive number, theinequality sign stays thesame. When wedivide or
multiply an inequality b y a negative number, the inequality sign r everses.
This gives us the Multiplication and Division Pr operty of Inequality.
Multiplication and Division Property of Inequality
For any numbers a,b, and c,Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations 171multipl y or divide b y a positiv e
ifa<bandc>0,thenac<bcandac<bc.
ifa>bandc>0,thenac>bcandac>bc.
multipl y or divide b y a neg ative
ifa<bandc<0,thenac>bcandac>bc.
ifa>bandc<0,thenac<bcandac<bc.
When we divide or multiply an inequality b ya:
•positive number, the inequality stays the same.
•negative number, the inequality r everses.
Sometimes when solving aninequality, asinthe nextexample, the variable ends upon the right. Wecan rewrite the
inequality in r everse to get the variable to the left.
x>ahas the same meaning as a<x
Think about it as “If Xander is taller than Andy, then Andy is shorter than Xander.”

Solve Compound Inequalities with “and”
Nowthat weknowhowtosolve linear inequalities, the nextstep istolook atcompound inequalities. Acompound
inequality ismade upoftwo inequalities connected bytheword“and” ortheword“or.” Forexample, thefollo wing are
compound inequalities.
x+3>−4 and 4x−5≤3
2(y+1)<0or y−5≥−2
Compound Inequality
Acompound inequality is made up of two inequalities connected b y the wor d “and” or the wor d “or.”
Tosolve acompound inequality means tofind allvalues ofthe variable that mak ethe compound inequality atrue
statement. Wesolve compound inequalities using thesame techniques weused tosolve linear inequalities. Wesolve each
inequality separ ately and then consider the two solutions.
Tosolve acompound inequality with theword“and,” welook forallnumbers that mak eboth inequalities true. Tosolve a
compound inequality with the wor d “or,” we look for all numbers that mak eeither inequality true.
Let’s start with the compound inequalities with “and.” Our solution will bethe numbers that aresolutions toboth
inequalities knownastheintersection ofthetwo inequalities. Consider theintersection oftwo streets—the part wher e
the str eets o verlap—belongs to both str eets.
Tofind thesolution ofthecompound inequality, welook atthegraphs ofeach inequality and then find thenumbers that
belong to both gr aphs—wher e the gr aphs o verlap.
For the compound inequality x>−3 and x≤2,wegraph each inequality. Wethen look forwher ethe graphs
“overlap”. The numbers that areshaded onboth graphs, willbeshaded onthegraph ofthesolution ofthecompound
inequality. See Figur e 2.5 .Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations 187Figur e 2.5
Wecan seethat thenumbers between −3 and 2areshaded onboth ofthefirst two graphs. Theywillthen beshaded
on the solution gr aph.
The number −3 isnotshaded onthefirst graph and sosince itisnotshaded onboth graphs, itisnotincluded onthe
solution gr aph.
The number two is shaded on both the first and second gr aphs. Ther efore, it is be shaded on the solution gr aph.
This is ho w we will sho w our solution in the ne xt examples.

Sometimes wehave acompound inequality that can bewritten mor econcisely. Forexample, a<xand x<bcan be
written simply as a<x<band then we call it a double inequality . The two forms ar e equivalent.
Double Inequality
A double inequality is a compound inequality such as a<x<b.It is equivalent to a<xand x<b.
Other forms:a<x<b is equivalent t o a<x and x<b
a≤x≤b is equivalent t o a≤x and x≤b
a>x>b is equivalent t o a>x and x>b

Solve Absolute V alue Equations
As we pr epar e to solve absolute value equations, we r eview our definition of absolute value .
Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance fr om zer o on the number line.
The absolute value of a number nis written as |n|and |n|≥0for all numbers.
Absolute values ar e always gr eater than or equal to zer o.
Welearned that both anumber and itsopposite arethesame distance fromzeroonthenumber line. Since theyhave the
same distance fr om zer o, the y have the same absolute value. For e xample:
−5is 5 units away fr om 0, so |−5|=5.
5is 5 units away fr om 0, so |5|=5.
Figur e 2.6 illustr ates this idea.
Figur e 2.6 The numbers 5 and −5 are both five
units away fr om zer o.
Fortheequation |x|=5,wearelooking forallnumbers that mak ethisatrue statement. Wearelooking forthenumbers
whose distance fromzerois5.Wejust saw that both 5and −5 arefive units fromzeroonthenumber line. Theyarethe
solutions to the equation.
If |x|=5
then x=−5 orx=5
The solution canbesimplified toasingle statement bywriting x=±5.This isread, “xisequal topositive ornegative 5”.
We can gener alize this to the follo wing pr operty for absolute value equations.198 Chapter 2 Solving Linear Equations

For any algebr aic e xpression, u, and any positive r eal number, a,
if |u|=a
then u=−aoru=a

Howwould wesolve them? Iftwo algebr aicexpressions areequal inabsolute value, then theyareeither equal toeach
other ornegatives ofeach other. The property forabsolute value equations says that forany algebr aicexpression, u,and
a positive r eal number, a, if|u|=a,then u=−aoru=a.
This tell us that
if |u|=|v|
then u=−v or u=v

Plot Points on a Rectangular Coor dinate System
Just likemaps use agrid system toidentify locations, agrid system isused inalgebr atoshowarelationship between
two variables inarectangular coor dinate system. The rectangular coor dinate system isalso called thexy-plane orthe
“coor dinate plane.”
The rectangular coor dinate system isformed bytwo intersecting number lines, one horizontal and one vertical. The
horizontal number line iscalled thex-axis. The vertical number line iscalled they-axis. These axesdivide aplane into four
regions, called quadr ants. The quadr ants areidentified byRoman numer als,beginning ontheupper right and proceeding
counter clockwise. See Figur e 3.2 .
Figur e 3.2
Intherectangular coor dinate system, every point isrepresented byanorderedpair .The first number intheorderedpair
isthex-coor dinate ofthepoint, and thesecond number isthey-coor dinate ofthepoint. The phrase“orderedpair” means
that the or der is important.
Ordered Pair
Anorderedpair ,(x,y)gives thecoor dinates ofapoint inarectangular coor dinate system. The first number isthe
x-coor dinate. The second number is the y-coor dinate.
What istheorderedpair ofthepoint wher etheaxescross? Atthat point both coor dinates arezero,soitsorderedpair is
(0,0).The point (0,0)has a special name. It is called the origin .
The Origin
The point (0,0)is called the origin . It is the point wher e the x-axis and y-axis intersect.
Weuse thecoor dinates tolocate apoint onthexy-plane. Let’s plot thepoint (1,3)asanexample. First, locate 1onthe
x-axis and lightly sketch avertical line through x=1.Then, locate 3onthey-axis and sketch ahorizontal line through
y=3.Now, find the point wher e these two lines meet—that is the point with coor dinates (1,3).SeeFigur e 3.3 .226 Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Notice that thevertical line through x=1and thehorizontal line through y=3arenotpart ofthegraph. Wejust used
them to help us locate the point (1,3).
When one ofthecoor dinate iszero,thepoint liesonone oftheaxes.InFigur e3.4thepoint (0,4)isonthey-axis and
the point (−2,0)is on the x-axis.
Figur e 3.4
Points on the Axes
Points with a y-coor dinate equal to 0 ar e on the x-axis, and have coor dinates (a,0).
Points with an x-coor dinate equal to 0 ar e on the y-axis, and have coor dinates (0,b).

ⓐ(−5,4)ⓑ(−3,−4)ⓒ(2,−3)ⓓ(0,−1)ⓔ⎛⎝3,52⎞⎠.
Solution
The first number ofthe coordinate pair isthe x-coordinate, and the second number isthe y-coordinate. Toplot each
point, sketch avertical line through thex-coordinate and ahorizontal line through they-coordinate. Their intersection
is the point.
ⓐSince x=−5,the point istothe left ofthe y-axis. Also, since y=4,the point isabove the x-axis. The point
(−5,4)is in Quadrant II.
ⓑSince x=−3,the point istothe left ofthe y-axis. Also, since y=−4,the point isbelow the x-axis. The pointChapter 3 Graphs and Functions 227(−3,−4)is in Quadrant III.
ⓒSince x=2,thepoint istotheright ofthey-axis. Since y=−3,thepoint isbelow thex-axis. The point (2,−3)

theequation you gotexactly one solution. Butequations can have mor ethan one variable. Equations with two variables
may be of the form Ax+By=C.An equation of this form is called a linear equation in two variables.
Linear Equation
Anequation oftheform Ax+By=C,wher eAand Barenotboth zero,iscalled alinear equation intwo variables.
Here is an e xample of a linear equation in two variables, xand y.

Standard Form of Linear Equation
A linear equation is in standar d form when it is written Ax+By=C.
Most people prefer tohave A,B,and Cbeintegers and A≥0when writing alinear equation instandar dform, although
it is not strictly necessary.
Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. Forevery number that issubstituted forxther eisacorresponding y

substitute these values ofxand yinto theequation, theresult isatrue statement, because thevalue ontheleftside is
equal to the value on the right side.

Find the Slope of a Line
When you graph linear equations, you may notice that some lines tiltupastheygofromlefttoright and some lines tilt
down. Some lines ar e very steep and some lines ar e flatter.
In mathematics, the measur e of the steepness of a line is called the slope of the line.
The concept ofslope hasmany applications intherealworld. Inconstruction thepitch ofaroof, theslant oftheplumbing

Quick Guide to the Slopes of Lines
Sometimes we’ll need tofind theslope ofalinebetween two points when wedon’t have agraph tocount outtherise and
therun. Wecould plot thepoints ongrid paper, then count outtherise and therun, butaswe’ll see, ther eisaway tofind
the slope without gr aphing. Befor e we get to it, we need to intr oduce some algebr aic notation.
Wehave seen that anorderedpair (x,y)gives thecoor dinates ofapoint. But when wework with slopes, weuse two
points. Howcan thesame symbol (x,y)beused torepresent two differ entpoints? Mathematicians use subscripts to
distinguish the points.Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions 257(x1,y1)read “xsub 1,ysub 1”
(x2,y2)read “xsub 2,ysub 2”
We will use (x1,y1)to identify the first point and (x2,y2)to identify the second point.
If we had mor e than two points, we could use (x3,y3),(x4,y4),and so on.
Let’s seehowtherise and run relate tothecoor dinates ofthetwo points bytaking another look attheslope oftheline
between the points (2,3)and (7,6),as sho wn in this gr aph.
Since w e have two points, w e will use subscr ipt notation.⎛

m=rise

On the graph, w e counted t he rise of 3 and t he run of 5. m=3

Notice t hat the rise of 3 can be f ound b y subtr acting t he
y-coor dinates, 6 and 3, and t he run of 5 can be f ound b y
subtr acting t hex-coor dinates 7 and 2.
We rewrite the rise and r un by putting in t he coor dinates. m=6−3
7−2
But 6 is y2,they-coor dinate of t he second point and 3 is y1,they-coor dinate
of the firs t point. So w e can r ewrite the slope using subscr ipt notation. m=y2−y1
7−2
Also 7 is t hex-coor dinate of t he second point and 2 is t hex-coor dinate
of the firs t point. So ag ain w e rewrite the slope using subscr ipt notation. m=y2−y1
x2−x1
We’ve shownthat m=y2−y1
x2−x1isreally another version ofm=rise
run.Wecanusethis formula tofind theslope ofaline
when we have two points on the line.
Slope of a line between two points
The slope of the line between two points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is:
m=y2−y1
x2−x1.
The slope is:
yof the second point minus yof the firs t point
over
xof the second point minus xof the firs t point.

Nowthat wehave seen severalmethods wecan use tograph lines, howdoweknowwhich method touse foragiven

While wecould plot points, usetheslope–inter cept form, orfind theinter cepts foranyequation, ifwerecognize themost
convenient way to gr aph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier.
Gener ally, plotting points isnotthemost efficient way tograph aline. Let’s look forsome patterns tohelp determine the
most convenient method to gr aph a line.
Here are five equations we gr aphed in this chapter, and the method we used to gr aph each of them.
Equation Method
#1x=2 Vertical line
#2y=−1 Horizont al line
#3−x+2y=6 Inter cepts
#44x−3y=12 Inter cepts
#5y=−x+4 Slope–inter cept
Equations #1and #2each have just one variable. Remember, inequations ofthis form thevalue ofthat one variable is
constant; itdoes notdepend onthevalue oftheother variable. Equations ofthis form have graphs that arevertical or
horizontal lines.
Inequations #3and #4,both xand yareonthe same side ofthe equation. These two equations areofthe form
Ax+By=C.Wesubstituted y=0tofind thex-inter cept and x=0tofind they-inter cept, and then found athird

Equation #5iswritten inslope–inter cept form. After identifying theslope and y-inter cept fromtheequation weused them
to gr aph the line.
This leads to the follo wing str ategy.
Strategy for Choosing the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line
Consider the form of the equation.
•If it only has one variable, it is a vertical or horizontal line.
◦x=ais a vertical line passing thr ough the x-axis at a.
◦y=bis a horizontal line passing thr ough the y-axis at b.
•Ifyisisolated onone side oftheequation, intheform y=mx+b,graph byusing theslope and y-inter cept.
◦Identify the slope and y-inter cept and then gr aph.
•If the equation is of the form Ax+By=C,find the inter cepts.
◦Find the x- and y-inter cepts, a thir d point, and then gr aph.

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that do not intersect.
•Parallel lines have the same slope and differ enty-inter cepts.
•Ifm1and m2are the slopes of two par allel lines then m1=m2.
•Parallel vertical lines have differ entx-inter cepts.
Since parallel lines have thesame slope and differ enty-inter cepts, wecannowjust look attheslope–inter cept form ofthe

We recognize right away from the equations that these are horizontal lines, and so we know their slopes are both 0.
Since thehorizontal lines cross they-axis aty=−4 and aty=3,weknow they-intercepts are (0,−4)and (0,3).
The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts and so they are parallel.

We recognize right away from the equations that these are vertical lines, and so we know their slopes are undefined.
Since the vertical lines cross the x-axis at x=−2 and x=−5,we know the y-intercepts are (−2,0)and (−5,0).
The lines are vertical and have different x-intercepts and so they are parallel.

Find an Equation of the Line Given the Slope and a Point
Finding anequation ofaline using theslope-inter cept form oftheequation works well when you aregiven theslope and
y-inter cept orwhen you read them offagraph. Butwhat happens when you have another point instead ofthey-inter cept?
We are going to use the slope formula to derive another form of an equation of the line.
Suppose wehave aline that hasslope mand that contains some specific point (x1,y1)and some other point, which we
will just call (x,y).We can write the slope of this line and then change it to a differ ent form.
m=y−y1
x−x1

⎝y−y1

⎠(x−x1)
Simplify. m(x−x1)=y−y1
Rewrite the eq uation wit h theyterms on t he lef t. y−y1=m(x−x1)
This format is called the point-slope form of an equation of a line.Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions 281Point-slope Form of an Equation of a Line
The point-slope form of an equation of a line with slope mand containing the point (x1,y1)is:
y−y1=m(x−x1)

Verify Solutions to an Inequality in T wo V ariables
Previously welearned tosolve inequalities with only one variable. Wewillnowlearn about inequalities containing two
variables. Inparticular wewilllook atlinear inequalities intwo variables which arevery similar tolinear equations intwo
variables.
Linear inequalities intwo variables have many applications. Ifyou ranabusiness, forexample, you would want your
revenue to be gr eater than your costs—so that your business made a pr ofit.
Linear Inequality
Alinear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the follo wing forms:
Ax+By>C Ax+By≥C Ax+By<C Ax+By≤C
Wher eAand Bare not both zer o.
Recall that aninequality with one variable had many solutions. Forexample, thesolution totheinequality x>3isany
number greater than 3.Weshowed this onthenumber line byshading inthenumber line totheright of3,and putting
an open par enthesis at 3. See Figur e 3.10 .
Figur e 3.10
Similarly, linear inequalities intwo variables have many solutions. Any orderedpair (x,y)that mak esaninequality true
when we substitute in the values is a solution to a linear inequality .
Solution to a Linear Inequality
Anorderedpair (x,y)isasolution toalinear inequality iftheinequality istrue when wesubstitute thevalues ofx
and y.

Recognize the Relation Between the Solutions of an Inequality and its Gr aph
Now, we will look at ho w the solutions of an inequality r elate to its gr aph.
Let’s think about thenumber line inshownpreviously again. The point x=3separ ated that number line into two parts.
Onone side of3areallthenumbers less than 3.Ontheother side of3allthenumbers aregreater than 3.See Figur e
3.11.
Figur e 3.11 The solution to x>3is the shaded part of the number
line to the right of x=3.
Similarly, theline y=x+4separ ates theplane into two regions. Onone side oftheline arepoints with y<x+4.On
the other side of the line ar e the points with y>x+4.We call the line y=x+4aboundary line .
Boundary Line
The line with equation Ax+By=Cistheboundary line that separ ates theregion wher eAx+By>Cfromthe
region wher eAx+By<C.
Foraninequality inone variable, theendpoint isshownwith aparenthesis orabracketdepending onwhether ornotais
included in the solution:
Similarly, foraninequality intwo variables, theboundary line isshownwith asolid ordashed line toshowwhether ornot
it the line is included in the solution.
Ax+By<C Ax+By≤C
Ax+By>C Ax+By≥C
Boundar y line is Ax+By=C Boundar y line is Ax+By=C
Boundar y line is no t included in solution. Boundar y line is included in solution.
Boundar y line is dashed. Boundar y line is solid.
Now,let’s takealook atwhat wefound inExample 3.34.We’llstart bygraphing theline y=x+4,and then we’ll plot
the five points we tested, as sho wn in the gr aph. See Figur e 3.12 .Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions 297Figur e 3.12
InExample 3.34 we found that some of the points wer e solutions to the inequality y>x+4and some wer e not.
Which of the points we plotted ar e solutions to the inequality y>x+4?
The points (1,6)and (−8,12)aresolutions totheinequality y>x+4.Notice that theyareboth onthesame side of
the boundary line y=x+4.
The two points (0,0)and (−5,−15 )areontheother side oftheboundary line y=x+4,and theyarenotsolutions
to the inequality y>x+4.For those two points, y<x+4.
What about thepoint (2,6)?Because 6=2+4,thepoint isasolution totheequation y=x+4,butnotasolution
to the inequality y>x+4.So the point (2,6)is on the boundary line.
Let’s takeanother point abovetheboundary line and test whether ornotitisasolution totheinequality y>x+4.The
point (0,10)clearly looks to abo ve the boundary line, doesn’t it? Is it a solution to the inequality?
y>x+4
10 >?0+4
10 >4
So,(0,10)is a solution to y>x+4.
Any point you choose abovetheboundary line isasolution totheinequality y>x+4.Allpoints abovetheboundary
line ar e solutions.
Similarly, allpoints belo wtheboundary line, theside with (0,0)and (−5,−15 ),arenotsolutions toy>x+4,as
shown in Figur e 3.13 .298 Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Figur e 3.13
The gr aph of the inequality y>x+4is sho wn in belo w.
The line y=x+4divides the plane into two r egions. The shaded side sho ws the solutions to the inequality y>x+4.
The points ontheboundary line, those wher ey=x+4,arenotsolutions totheinequality y>x+4,sothelineitself
is not part of the solution. W e sho w that b y making the line dashed, not solid.
EXAMPLE 3.35Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions 299The boundary line sho wn in this gr aph is y=2x−1.Write the inequality sho wn b y the gr aph.
Solution
The line y=2x−1istheboundary line. Onone side oftheline arethepoints with y>2x−1and ontheother side of
the line ar e the points with y<2x−1.
Let’s test the point (0,0)and see which inequality describes its position r elative to the boundary line.
At(0,0),which inequality is true: y>2x−1ory<2x−1?
y>2x−1 y<2x−1
0>?2·0−1 0<?2·0−1
0>−1True 0<−1False
Since, y>2x−1istrue, theside oftheline with (0,0),isthesolution. The shaded region showsthesolution ofthe
inequality y>2x−1.
Since the boundary line is gr aphed with a solid line, the inequality includes the equal sign.
The gr aph sho ws the inequality y≥2x−1.
Wecould useany point asatest point, provided itisnotontheline. Why didwechoose (0,0)?Because it’stheeasiest
to evaluate. Y ou may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that y<2x−1.300 Chapter 3 Graphs and Functions

Let’s test the point (0,0)and see which inequality describes its side of the boundary line.

(You may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that 2x+3y>6.)

Determine if a Relation is a Function
Aspecial type ofrelation, called afunction ,occurs extensively inmathematics. Afunction isarelation that assigns toeach
element initsdomain exactly one element intherange. Foreach orderedpair intherelation, each x-value ismatched
with only one y-value.
Function
Afunction is a r elation that assigns to each element in its domain e xactly one element in the r ange.
The birthday example fromExample 3.43 helps usunderstand this definition. Every person has abirthday but noone
hastwo birthdays. Itisokay fortwo people toshar eabirthday. Itisokay that Danny and Stephen shar eJuly24thastheir
birthday and that June and Lizshar eAugust 2nd.Since each person hasexactly one birthday, therelation inExample 3.43
is a function.
The relation shownbythegraph inExample 3.44 includes theorderedpairs (−3,−1)and (−3,4).Isthat okay ina
function? No, as this is lik e one person having two differ ent birthdays.

Anorderedpair (x,y)isasolution ofalinear equation, iftheequation isatrue statement when thex-and y-values of
the or dered pair ar e substituted into the equation.
The graph ofalinear equation isastraight line wher eevery point ontheline isasolution oftheequation and every

This leads ustothevertical line test. Asetofpoints inarectangular coor dinate system isthegraph ofafunction ifevery

Through our earlier work, wearefamiliar with the graphs oflinear equations. The process weused todecide if
y=2x−3isafunction would apply toalllinear equations. Allnon-vertical linear equations arefunctions. Vertical lines
are not functions as the x-value has infinitely many y-values.

The systems ofequations inExample 4.2and Example 4.3each had two intersecting lines. Each system had one solution.
InExample 4.5 , the equations gave coincident lines, and so the system had infinitely many solutions.

Solve a System of Equations b y Elimination
Wehave solved systems oflinear equations bygraphing and bysubstitution. Graphing works well when thevariable
coefficients aresmall and thesolution hasinteger values. Substitution works well when wecaneasily solve one equation378 Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5for one of the variables and not have too many fr actions in the r esulting e xpression.
The thirdmethod ofsolving systems oflinear equations iscalled theElimination Method. When wesolved asystem by
substitution, westarted with two equations and two variables and reduced ittoone equation with one variable. This is
what we’ll do with the elimination method, too, but we’ll have a differ ent way to get ther e.
The Elimination Method isbased ontheAddition Property ofEquality. The Addition Property ofEquality says that when
you add thesame quantity toboth sides ofanequation, you stillhave equality. Wewillextend theAddition Property of
Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the r esults ar e equal.
For any e xpressions a, b, c,and d.
if a=b
and c=d
then a+c=b+d.
Tosolve asystem ofequations byelimination, westart with both equations instandar dform. Then wedecide which
variable willbeeasiest toeliminate. Howdowedecide? Wewant tohave thecoefficients ofone variable beopposites, so
that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.
Notice ho w that works when we add these two equations together:
⎧
⎩⎨3x+y=5
2x−y=0—————
5x =5
The y’s add to zer o and we have one equation with one variable.
Let’s try another one:
⎧
⎩⎨x+4y=2
2x+5y=−2
This time we don’t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.
Butifwemultiply thefirst equation by−2,wewillmak ethecoefficients ofxopposites. Wemust multiply every term on
both sides of the equation b y−2.
Then r ewrite the system of equations.
Now we see that the coefficients of the xterms ar e opposites, so xwill be eliminated when we add these two equations.
Once weget anequation with just one variable, wesolve it.Then wesubstitute that value into one ofthe original
equations tosolve fortheremaining variable. And, asalways, wecheck ouranswer tomak esureitisasolution toboth of
the original equations.
Now we’ll see ho w to use elimination to solve the same system of equations we solved b y graphing and b y substitution.

using the table her e. The basic equation was D=rtwher eDis the distance tr aveled, ris the r ate, and tis the time.
Our first example ofauniform motion application willbeforasituation similar tosome wehave already seen, butnow

left St. Louis on the same r oute as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. Ho w long will it tak e Kelly to catch up to Joni?
Solution
A diagr am is useful in helping us visualize the situation.
Identify and name what wearelooking for. Achart willhelp usorganize thedata. Weknowtherates ofboth Joni and
Kelly, and so we enter them in the chart. W e are looking for the length of time Kelly, k, and Joni, j, will each drive.
Since D=r·twe can fill in the Distance column.
Translate into a system of equations.
To mak e the system of equations, we must r ecognize that Kelly and Joni will drive the same distance. So,
65j=78k
Also, since Kelly left later, her time will be1

Many real-world applications ofuniform motion arise because oftheeffects ofcurrents—of water orair—on theactual

A chart will help us or ganize the information.
The jet mak es two trips—one in a tailwind

In a tailwind, the wind helps the jet and so
the r ate is j+w.
In a headwind, the wind slo ws the jet and
so the r ate is j‒w.
Each trip tak es 3 hours.
In a tailwind the jet flies 1,095 miles.
In a headwind the jet flies 987 miles.

Solution
Step 1. Read the pr oblem. We will cr eate a table to or ganize the information.
Step 2. Identify what we ar e looking for. We are looking for the number of adult tick ets
and the number of child tick ets sold.
Step 3. Name what we ar e looking for. Leta=the number of adult tick ets.
c=the number of child tick ets
A table will help us or ganize the data.
We have two types of tick ets, adult and child.Write in aand cfor the number of tick ets.Chapter 4 Systems of Linear Equations 407Write the total number of tick ets sold at the bottom
of the Number column.Altogether 1,363 wer e sold.
Write the value of each type of tick et in the
Value column.The value of each adult tick et is $12.
The value of each child tick ets is $7.
The number times the value gives the total value,
so the total value of adult tick ets is a·12=12a,
and the total value of child tick ets is c·7=7c.Fill in the T otal V alue column.
Altogether the total value of the tick ets was $12,146.
Step 4. T ranslate into a system of equations.
The Number column and the T otal value column
give us the system of equations.
We will use the elimination method to solve
this system. Multiply the first equation b y−7.
Simplify and add, then solve for a.
Substitute a=521 into the first equation, then
solve for c.
Step 6. Check the answer in the

Solution
Step 1. Read the pr oblem.
We will cr eate a table to or ganize the information.
Step 2. Identify what we ar e looking for. We are looking for the number of
nickels and the number of dimes.
Step 3. Name what we ar e looking for. Letn=the number of nick els.
d=the number of dimes
A table will help us or ganize the data.
We have two types of coins, nick els and dimes.Writenand dfor the number of
each type of coin.
Fill in the V alue column with the value of each
type of coin.The value of each nick el is $0.05.
The value of each dime is $0.10.
The number times the value gives the total
value, so, the total value of the nick els is
n(0.05 )=0.05 nand the total value of dimes is
d(0.10 )=0.10 d.
Altogether the total value of the coins is $8.10.
Step 4. T ranslate into a system of equations.
The T otal V alue column gives one equation.
We also kno w the number of dimes is 9 less than
twice the number of nick els.

Solve applications of cost and r evenue functions
Suppose acompany mak esand sells xunits ofaproduct. The cost tothecompany isthetotal costs toproduce xunits.
This is the cost to manufactur e for each unit times x, the number of units manufactur ed, plus the fix ed costs.
The revenue isthemone ythecompany brings inasaresult ofselling xunits. This istheselling price ofeach unit times
the number of units sold.
When the costs equal the r evenue we say the business has r eached the break-e ven point .
Cost and Revenue Functions
The cost function isthecost tomanufactur eeach unit times x,thenumber ofunits manufactur ed,plus thefixed

C(x)=⎛⎝cost per unit⎞⎠·x+fixed cos ts
The revenue function is the selling price of each unit times x, the number of units sold.
R(x)=⎛⎝selling pr ice per unit⎞⎠·x
The break-e ven point is when the r evenue equals the costs.
C(x)=R(x)

Determine Whether an Or dered T riple is a Solution of a System of Thr ee Linear
Equations with Thr ee V ariables
Inthis section, wewillextend our work ofsolving asystem oflinear equations. Sofarwehave work edwith systems of
equations with two equations and two variables. Nowwewillwork with systems ofthreeequations with threevariables.
But first let's r eview what we alr eady kno w about solving equations and systems involving up to two variables.
Welearned earlier that thegraph ofalinear equation ,ax+by=c,isaline. Each point ontheline, anorderedpair
(x,y),isasolution totheequation. Forasystem oftwo equations with two variables, wegraph two lines. Then wecan
seethat allthepoints that aresolutions toeach equation form aline. And, byfinding what thelines have incommon, we’ll
find the solution to the system.
Most linear equations inone variable have one solution, butwesaw that some equations, called contr adictions, have no
solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers ar e solutions
Weknowwhen wesolve asystem oftwo linear equations represented byagraph oftwo lines inthesame plane, ther e
are thr ee possible cases, as sho wn.

HOW TO : : SOLVE A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH THREE VARIABLES.
Write the equations in standar d form
◦If any coefficients ar e fractions, clear them.
Eliminate the same variable fr om two equations.
◦Decide which variable you will eliminate.
◦Work with a pair of equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
◦Multiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable ar e opposites.
◦Add the equations r esulting fr om Step 2 to eliminate one variable
Repeat Step 2 using two other equations and eliminate the same variable as in Step 2.
The two ne w equations form a system of two equations with two variables. Solve this system.

Solving asystem ofequations canbeatedious oper ation wher easimple mistak ecanwreakhavoc onfinding thesolution.
Analternative method which uses thebasic procedur esofelimination butwith notation that issimpler isavailable. The
method involves using a matrix . A matrix is a r ectangular arr ay of numbers arr anged in r ows and columns.
Matrix
Amatrix is a r ectangular arr ay of numbers arr anged in r ows and columns.
Amatrix with mrowsand ncolumns hasorder m×n.The matrix ontheleftbelo whas2rowsand 3columns and so
it has or der 2×3.We say it is a 2 b y 3 matrix.
Each number in the matrix is called an element or entry in the matrix.
Wewill use amatrix torepresent asystem oflinear equations. Wewrite each equation instandar dform and the
coefficients ofthevariables and theconstant ofeach equation becomes arowinthematrix. Each column then would be
thecoefficients ofone ofthevariables inthesystem ortheconstants. Avertical line replaces theequal signs. Wecallthe
resulting matrix the augmented matrix for the system of equations.
Notice thefirst column ismade upofallthecoefficients ofx,thesecond column istheallthecoefficients ofy,and the
third column is all the constants.

Use Ro w Oper ations on a Matrix
Once asystem ofequations isinitsaugmented matrix form, wewillperform oper ations ontherowsthat willlead usto
the solution.
Tosolve byelimination, itdoesn’t matter which orderweplace theequations inthesystem. Similarly, inthematrix wecan
inter change the r ows.
When wesolve byelimination, weoften multiply one ofthe equations byaconstant. Since each rowrepresents an
equation, and wecanmultiply each side ofanequation byaconstant, similarly wecanmultiply each entry inarowbyany
real number e xcept 0.
Inelimination, weoften add amultiple ofone rowtoanother row.Inthematrix wecanreplace arowwith itssum with a
multiple of another r ow.
These actions ar e called r ow oper ations and will help us use the matrix to solve a system of equations.
Row Operations
Inamatrix, thefollo wing oper ations can beperformed onany rowand theresulting matrix willbeequivalent tothe

Row-Echelon Form
Foraconsistent and independent system ofequations, itsaugmented matrix isinrow-echelon form when totheleft
of the vertical line, each entry on the diagonal is a 1 and all entries belo w the diagonal ar e zer os.
Once wegettheaugmented matrix into row-echelon form, wecan write theequivalent system ofequations and read
thevalue ofatleast one variable. Wethen substitute this value inanother equation tocontinue tosolve fortheother
variables. This pr ocess is illustr ated in the ne xt example.

POLYNOMIALS AND POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 5Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions 487Determine the Degr ee of Polynomials
Wehave learned that aterm isaconstant ortheproduct ofaconstant and one ormor evariables. Amonomial isan
algebr aicexpression with one term. When itisoftheform axm,wher eaisaconstant and misawhole number, itis
called amonomial inone variable. Some examples ofmonomial inone variable are.Monomials canalso have mor ethan
one variable such as and −4a2b3c2.
Monomial
Amonomial is an algebr aic e xpression with one term.
A monomial in one variable is a term of the form axm,wher eais a constant and mis a whole number.
Amonomial, ortwo ormor emonomials combined byaddition orsubtr action, isapolynomial .Some polynomials have
special names, based onthenumber ofterms. Amonomial isapolynomial with exactly one term. Abinomial hasexactly
two terms, and atrinomial has exactly threeterms. Ther earenospecial names forpolynomials with mor ethan three
terms.
Polynomials
polynomial —A monomial, or two or mor e algebr aic terms combined b y addition or subtr action is a polynomial.
monomial —A polynomial with e xactly one term is called a monomial.
binomial —A polynomial with e xactly two terms is called a binomial.
trinomial —A polynomial with e xactly thr ee terms is called a trinomial.
Here are some e xamples of polynomials.

Trinomial x2−7x+12 9m2+2mn−8n26k4−k3+8k z4+3z2−1
Notice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial isalso apolynomial. Theyarejust special members ofthe“family” of
polynomials and sotheyhave special names. Weusethewordsmonomial ,binomial ,and trinomial when referring tothese
special polynomials and just call all the r estpolynomials .
The degr ee of a polynomial and the degr ee of its terms ar e determined b y the e xponents of the variable.
A monomial that has no variable, just a constant, is a special case. The degr ee of a constant is 0.
Degree of a Polynomial
The degr ee of a term is the sum of the e xponents of its variables.
The degr ee of a constant is 0.
The degr ee of a polynomial is the highest degr ee of all its terms.
Let’s seehowthis works bylooking atseveralpolynomials. We’lltakeitstep bystep, starting with monomials, and then
progressing to polynomials with mor e terms.
Let's start bylooking atamonomial. The monomial 8ab2has two variables aand b.Tofind thedegr eeweneed tofind

Simplify Expr essions Using the Pr operties for Exponents
Remember that anexponent indicates repeated multiplication ofthesame quantity. Forexample, intheexpression am,
theexponent m tells us ho w many times we use the base a as a factor.
Let’s r eview the vocabulary for e xpressions with e xponents.
Exponential Notation
This is r ead ato the mthpower.
In the e xpression am,theexponent m tells us ho w many times we use the base a as a factor.
When wecombine liketerms byadding and subtr acting, weneed tohave thesame base with thesame exponent. But
when you multiply and divide, the e xponents may be differ ent, and sometimes the bases may be differ ent, too.
First, we will look at an e xample that leads to the Product Pr operty .
What does this mean?
Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions 501Notice that 5 is the sum of the e xponents, 2 and 3. W e see x2·x3isx2+3orx5.
The base stayed the same and we added the e xponents. This leads to the Pr oduct Pr operty for Exponents.

Ifyou multiply binomials often enough you may notice apattern. Notice that thefirst term intheresult istheproduct of
thefirst terms ineach binomial. The second and thirdterms aretheproduct ofmultiplying thetwo outer terms and then
the two inner terms. And the last term r esults fr om multiplying the two lastterms,
Weabbr eviate “First, Outer, Inner, Last” asFOIL. The letters stand for‘First, Outer, Inner, Last’. Weuse this asanother
method of multiplying binomials. The wor d FOIL is easy to r emember and ensur es we find all four pr oducts.
Let’s multiply (x+3)(x+7)using both methods.

Multiplying a Polynomial by a Polynomial
To multiply a trinomial b y a binomial, use the:
•Distributive Pr operty
•Vertical Method
Multiply Special Pr oducts
Mathematicians liketolook forpatterns that willmak etheir work easier. Agood example ofthis issquaring binomials.
While you can always gettheproduct bywriting thebinomial twice and multiplying them, ther eisless work todoifyou
learn to use a pattern. Let’s start b y looking at thr ee examples and look for a pattern.
Look at these r esults. Do you see any patterns?
What about the number of terms? In each e xample we squar ed a binomial and the r esult was a trinomial.
(a+b)2=___ +___ +___
Now look at the first term in each r esult. Wher e did it come fr om?
The first term istheproduct ofthefirst terms ofeach binomial. Since thebinomials areidentical, itisjust thesquar eof
the first term!
(a+b)2=a2+___ +___
To get the first term of the pr oduct, squar e the first term.
Wher e did the last term come fr om? Look at the e xamples and find the pattern.
The last term is the pr oduct of the last terms, which is the squar e of the last term.
(a+b)2=___ +___ +b2
To get the last term of the pr oduct, squar e the last term.
Finally, look atthemiddle term .Notice itcame fromadding the“outer” and the“inner” terms—which areboth thesame!
So the middle term is double the pr oduct of the two terms of the binomial.530 Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5(a+b)2=___+2ab+___
(a−b)2=___−2ab+___
To get the middle term of the pr oduct, multiply the terms and double their pr oduct.
Putting it all together:
Binomial Squares Pattern
Ifaand bare real numbers,
To squar e a binomial, squar e the first term, squar e the last term , double their pr oduct.
EXAMPLE 5.32

Wejust saw apattern forsquaring binomials that wecanusetomak emultiplying some binomials easier. Similarly, ther e
is a pattern for another pr oduct of binomials. But befor e we get to it, we need to intr oduce some vocabulary.Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions 531Apair ofbinomials that each have thesame first term and thesame lastterm, butone isasum and one isadiffer ence is
called a conjugate pair and is of the form (a−b),(a+b).
Conjugate Pair
Aconjugate pair is two binomials of the form
(a−b),(a+b).
The pair ofbinomials each have thesame first term and thesame lastterm, butone binomial isasum and theother
is a differ ence.
Ther eisanice pattern forfinding theproduct ofconjugates. Youcould, ofcourse, simply FOIL togettheproduct, but
using the pattern mak es your work easier. Let’s look for the pattern b y using FOIL to multiply some conjugate pairs.
What do you observe about the pr oducts?
The pr oduct of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the pr oducts r esulting fr om FOIL have been trinomials.
Each first term istheproduct ofthefirst terms ofthebinomials, and since theyareidentical itisthesquar eofthefirst
term.
(a+b)(a−b)=a2−___
To get the first term, squar e the first term.
The last term came fr om multiplying the last terms, the squar e of the last term.
(a+b)(a−b)=a2−b2
To get the last term, squar e the last term .
Why isther enomiddle term? Notice thetwo middle terms you getfromFOIL combine to0inevery case, theresult ofone
addition and one subtr action.
The pr oduct of conjugates is always of the form a2−b2.This is called a differ ence of squar es.
This leads to the pattern:
Product of Conjugates Pattern
Ifaand bare real numbers,
The pr oduct is called a differ ence of squar es.
To multiply conjugates, squar e the first term, squar e the last term, write it as a differ ence of squar es.
EXAMPLE 5.33
Multiply using the pr oduct of conjugates pattern: ⓐ(2x+5)(2x−5)ⓑ(5m−9n)(5m+9n).
Solution
ⓐ532 Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Are the binomials conjugates?
It is the pr oduct of conjugates.
Squar e the first term, 2x.
Squar e the last term, 5.
Simplify. The pr oduct is a differ ence of squar es.
ⓑ
This fits the pattern.
Use the pattern.

TRY IT : : 5.66Multiply: ⓐ(2x+7)(2x−7)ⓑ⎛⎝3x−y⎞⎠⎛⎝3x+y⎞⎠.
Wejust developed special product patterns forBinomial Squar esand fortheProduct ofConjugates. The products look
similar, soitisimportant torecognize when itisappr opriate touse each ofthese patterns and tonotice howtheydiffer.
Look at the two patterns together and note their similarities and differ ences.
Comparing the Special Product Patterns
Binomial Squar es Product of Conjugates
(a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2(a−b)(a+b)=a2−b2
(a−b)2=a2−2ab+b2
• Squaring a binomial • Multiplying conjugates
• Product is a trinomial • Product is a binomial.
• Inner and outer terms with FOIL ar ethe
same.• Inner and outer terms with FOIL ar e
opposites.
• Middle term is double the pr oduct of the

If we e valuate this at c,we get:
This leads us to the Remainder Theor em.
Remainder Theorem
If the polynomial function f(x)is divided b yx−c,then the r emainder is f(c).
EXAMPLE 5.45

Solution
TousetheRemainder Theor em, wemust usethedivisor inthe x−cform. Wecanwrite thedivisor x+2asx−(−2).
So, our cis−2.
To find the r emainder, we e valuate f(c)which is f(−2).548 Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions

⎛

⎠(2a+3)=8a3+27
Written this way, wecan see that 4a2−6a+9and 2a+3arefactors of8a3+27.When wedidthedivision, the
remainder was zer o.
Whene veradivisor, x−c,divides apolynomial function, f(x),and resulting inaremainder ofzero,wesay x−cisa
factor of f(x).
The reverse isalso true. Ifx−cisafactor off(x)then x−cwill divide the polynomial function resulting ina
remainder of zer o.
We will state this in the Factor Theor em.
Factor Theorem
For any polynomial function f(x),
•ifx−cis a factor of f(x),then f(c)=0
•iff(c)=0,then x−cis a factor of f(x)
EXAMPLE 5.46
Use the Remainder Theor em to determine if x−4is a factor of f(x)=x3−64.Chapter 5 Polynomials and Polynomial Functions 549Solution
The Factor Theor em tells us that x−4is a factor of f(x)=x3−64iff(4)=0.
f(x)=x3−64
To evaluate f(4)substitute x=4. f(4)=43−64
Simplify. f(4)=64−64

Since f(4)=0,x−4is a factor of f(x)=x3−64.

Inthe first example, allterms inthe trinomial werepositive. What happens when ther earenegative terms? Well,it
depends which term is negative. Let’s look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative.
How do you get a positive pr oduct and a negative sum ? We use two negative numbers.

Now,what ifthelast term inthetrinomial isnegative? Think about FOIL .The last term istheproduct ofthelast terms
inthetwo binomials. Anegative product results frommultiplying two numbers with opposite signs. Youhave tobevery
careful to choose factors to mak e sur e you get the corr ect sign for the middle term, too.
How do you get a negative pr oduct and a positive sum ? We use one positive and one negative number.

Let’s summarize the method we just de veloped to factor trinomials of the form x2+bx+c.578 Chapter 6 Factoring
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Strategy for Factoring Trinomials of the Form x2+bx+c
When we factor a trinomial, we look at the signs of its terms first to determine the signs of the binomial factors.

(x+m)(x+n)
When cis positiv e,mand nhave the same sign.
bpositiv e bnegative
m,npositiv e m,nnegative

(x+4)(x−3) (x−5)(x+3)
opposite signs opposite signs
Notice that, inthecase when mand nhave opposite signs, thesign oftheone with thelargerabsolute value matches
the sign of b.
Factor T rinomials of the form ax2+bx+cusing T rial and Err or
Our ne xt step is to factor trinomials whose leading coefficient is not 1, trinomials of the form ax2+bx+c.
Remember toalways check foraGCF first! Sometimes, after you factor theGCF, theleading coefficient ofthetrinomial
becomes 1 and you can factor it b y the methods we’ve used so far. Let’s do an e xample to see ho w this works.
EXAMPLE 6.14

Also, to completely factor the binomial in the ne xt example, we’ll factor a differ ence of squar es twice!

Wehave spent consider able time learning howtofactor polynomials. Wewillnowlook atpolynomial equations and solve
them using factoring, if possible.
Apolynomial equation isanequation that contains apolynomial expression. The degr eeofthe polynomial equation
is the degr ee of the polynomial.
Polynomial Equation
Apolynomial equation is an equation that contains a polynomial e xpression.
The degr ee of the polynomial equation is the degr ee of the polynomial.
Wehave already solved polynomial equations ofdegr eeone.Polynomial equations ofdegr eeone arelinear equations
are of the form ax+b=c.
Wearenowgoing tosolve polynomial equations ofdegr eetwo.Apolynomial equation ofdegr eetwo iscalled aquadr atic
equation . Listed belo w ar e some e xamples of quadr atic equations:
x2+5x+6=0 3y2+4y=10 64u2−81=0 n(n+1)=42
The lastequation doesn’t appear tohave thevariable squar ed,butwhen wesimplify theexpression ontheleftwewillget
n2+n.
The gener alform ofaquadr aticequation isax2+bx+c=0,with a≠0.(Ifa=0,then 0·x2=0and weareleft
with no quadr atic term.)
Quadratic Equation
An equation of the form ax2+bx+c=0is called a quadr atic equation.
a,b,and care real numbers and a≠0
Tosolve quadr atic equations weneed methods differ entfromtheones weused insolving linear equations. Wewilllook
at one method her e and then se veral others in a later chapter.
Use the Zer o Pr oduct Pr operty
Wewillfirst solve some quadr atic equations byusing theZeroProduct Property .The ZeroProduct Property says that if
theproduct oftwo quantities iszero,then atleast one ofthequantities iszero.The only way togetaproduct equal to
zero is to multiply b y zer o itself.Chapter 6 Factoring 615Zero Product Property
Ifa·b=0,then either a=0orb=0or both.
We will no w use the Zer o Product Pr operty, to solve a quadr atic equation .

Solve Equations with Polynomial Functions
Asour study ofpolynomial functions continues, itwilloften beimportant toknowwhen thefunction willhave acertain
value orwhat points lieonthegraph ofthefunction. Our work with theZeroProduct Property willbehelp usfind these
answers.
EXAMPLE 6.50
For the function f(x)=x2+2x−2,
ⓐfind xwhen f(x)=6
ⓑfind two points that lie on the gr aph of the function.Chapter 6 Factoring 619Solution
ⓐ
f(x)=x2+2x−2
Subs titute 6 f orf(x). 6=x2+2x−2
Put the quadratic in s tandar d form. x2+2x−8=0
Factor the trinomial. (x+4)(x−2)=0
Use t he zer o product pr operty.
Solve.x+4=0 or x−2=0
x=−4 or x=2
Chec k:
f(x)=x2+2x−2 f(x)=x2+2x−2
f(−4)=(−4)2+2(−4)−2 f(2)=22+2·2−2
f(−4)=16−8−2 f(2)=4+4−2
f(−4)=6✓ f(2)=6✓
ⓑSince f(−4)=6and f(2)=6,the points (−4,6)and (2,6)lie on the graph of the function.
TRY IT : : 6.99For the function f(x)=x2−2x−8,
ⓐfind xwhen f(x)=7
ⓑFind two points that lie on the gr aph of the function.
TRY IT : : 6.100For the function f(x)=x2−8x+3,
ⓐfind xwhen f(x)=−4
ⓑFind two points that lie on the gr aph of the function.
The ZeroProduct Property also helps usdetermine wher ethefunction iszero.Avalue ofxwher ethefunction is0,iscalled
azero of the function .
Zero of a Function
For any function f, iff(x)=0,then xis azero of the function .
When f(x)=0,thepoint (x,0)isapoint onthegraph. This point isanx-inter cept ofthegraph. Itisoften important
to kno w wher e the gr aph of a function cr osses the ax es. W e will see some e xamples later.
EXAMPLE 6.51
For the function f(x)=3x2+10x−8,find
ⓐthe zer os of the function,
ⓑany x-inter cepts of the gr aph of the function
ⓒany y-inter cepts of the gr aph of the function
Solution
ⓐTo find the zeros of the function, we need to find when the function value is 0.620 Chapter 6 Factoring

Use t he zer o product pr operty.
Solve.x+4=0or3x−2=0
x=−4orx=23
ⓑAnx-intercept occurs when y=0.Since f(−4)=0and f⎛
⎝2
3⎞
⎠=0,the points (−4,0)and⎛
⎝2
3,0⎞
⎠lieonthe
graph. These points are x-intercepts of the function.
ⓒAy-intercept occurs when x=0.To find the y-intercepts we need to find f(0).
f(x)=3x2+10x−8
Find f(0)by subs tituting 0 f orx. f(0)=3·02+10·0−8
Simplify. f(0)=−8
Since f(0)=−8,the point (0,−8)lies on the graph. This point is the y-intercept of the function.

Step 3. Name what you ar e looking for. Letw=the width of the bedr oom.
The length is four feet mor e than the width. w+4=the length of the gar den
Step 4. T ranslate into an equation.
Restate the important information in a sentence. The ar ea of the bedr oom is 117 squar e

Wepreviously reviewed the properties offractions and their oper ations. Weintroduced rational numbers, which are
just fractions wher ethenumer ators and denominators areintegers. Inthis chapter, wewillwork with fractions whose
numer ators and denominators ar e polynomials. W e call this kind of e xpression a rational e xpression .
Rational Expression
A rational e xpression is an e xpression of the formp
q,wher epand qare polynomials and q≠0.
Here are some e xamples of r ational e xpressions:
−24
565x
12y4x+1
x2−94x2+3x−1
2x−8
Notice that thefirst rational expression listed above,−24
56,isjust afraction. Since aconstant isapolynomial with degr ee
zero, the r atio of two constants is a r ational e xpression, pr ovided the denominator is not zer o.
Wewill dothe same oper ations with rational expressions that wedidwith fractions. Wewill simplify, add, subtr act,
multiply, divide and use them in applications.
Determine the V alues for Which a Rational Expr ession is Undefined
Ifthedenominator iszero,therational expression isundefined. The numer ator ofarational expression may be0—but
not the denominator.
When wework with anumerical fraction, itiseasy toavoid dividing byzerobecause wecan see the number inthe
denominator. Inordertoavoid dividing byzeroinarational expression, wemust notallowvalues ofthevariable that will
mak e the denominator be zer o.
Sobefor ewebegin any oper ation with arational expression, weexamine itfirst tofind thevalues that would mak ethe
denominator zero.That way, when wesolve arational equation forexample, wewillknowwhether thealgebr aicsolutions
we find ar e allo wed or not.

Similarly, a simplified r ational e xpression has no common factors, other than 1, in its numer ator and denominator.
Simplified Rational Expression
A rational e xpression is consider ed simplified if ther e are no common factors in its numer ator and denominator.
For e xample,
x+2
x+3is sim plified because t here are no common f actors of x+2and x+3.
2x

Nowwewill see howtosimplify arational expression whose numer ator and denominator have opposite factors. We
previously intr oduced opposite notation: the opposite of ais−aand −a=−1·a.
The numerical fraction, say7
−7simplifies to−1.Wealso recognize that thenumer ator and denominator areopposites.
The fr actiona
−a, whose numer ator and denominator ar e opposites also simplifies to −1.
Let’s look at t he expression b−a. b−a
Rewrite. −a+b
Factor out –1. −1(a−b)
This tells us that b−ais the opposite of a−b.
In gener al, we could write the opposite of a−basb−a.So the r ational e xpressiona−b
b−asimplifies to −1.
Opposites in a Rational Expression
The opposite of a−bisb−a.

Find the Least Common Denominator of Rational Expr essions
When weadd orsubtr actrational expressions with unlik edenominators, wewillneed togetcommon denominators. If

denominator (L CD).
Tofind theLCDofthefractions, wefactor ed12and 18into primes, lining upany common primes incolumns. Then we
“brought do wn” one prime fr om each column. Finally, we multiplied the factors to find the L CD.
When weadd numerical fractions, once wefound theLCD, werewroteeach fraction asanequivalent fraction with the
LCD b y multiplying the numer ator and denominator b y the same number. W e are no w ready to add.

Solve Rational Equations
Wehave already solved linear equations that contained fractions. Wefound theLCDofallthefractions intheequation
and then multiplied both sides of the equation b y the L CD to “clear” the fr actions.
Wewilluse thesame strategy tosolve rational equations. Wewillmultiply both sides oftheequation bytheLCD. Then,
wewillhave anequation that does notcontain rational expressions and thus ismuch easier forustosolve. Butbecause
theoriginal equation may have avariable inadenominator, wemust becareful that wedon’t end upwith asolution that
would mak e a denominator equal to zer o.
Sobefor ewebegin solving arational equation, weexamine itfirst tofind thevalues that would mak eany denominators
zero. That way, when we solve a r ational equation we will kno w if ther e are any algebr aic solutions we must discar d.
Analgebr aicsolution toarational equation that would cause any oftherational expressions tobeundefined iscalled an
extraneous solution to a r ational equation .
Extraneous Solution to a Rational Equation
Anextraneous solution toarational equation isanalgebr aicsolution that would cause any oftheexpressions in
the original equation to be undefined.

Solve Pr oportions
When two r ational e xpressions ar e equal, the equation r elating them is called a proportion .
Proportion
Aproportion is an equation of the forma
b=c

The pr oportion is r ead “ ais to bascis to d.”
The equation1

Solution
This is a uniform motion situation. A diagr am will help us visualize the situation.
We fill in the chart to or ganize the information.
We are looking for the speed of the airplane. Letr= the speed of the airplane.
When the plane flies with the wind,
the wind incr eases its speed and so the r ate is r+ 30.
When the plane flies against the wind,
the wind decr eases its speed and the r ate is r− 30.
Write in the r ates.
Write in the distances.
Since D=r·t,we solve for tand get t=Dr.
We divide the distance b y the r ate in each r ow, and

Solve Rational Inequalities
Welearned tosolve linear inequalities after learning tosolve linear equations. The techniques werevery much thesame
with one major e xception. When we multiplied or divided b y a negative number, the inequality sign r eversed.
Having just learned tosolve rational equations wearenowready tosolve rational inequalities. Arational inequality isan
inequality that contains a r ational e xpression.
Rational Inequality
Arational inequality is an inequality that contains a r ational e xpression.
Inequalities such as3
2x>1,2x
x−3<4,2x−3
x−6≥x,and1
4−2
x2≤3
xarerational inequalities astheyeach contain
a rational e xpression.
When wesolve arational inequality, wewillusemany ofthetechniques weused solving linear inequalities. Weespecially
must r emember that when we multiply or divide b y a negative number, the inequality sign must r everse.
Another differ ence isthat wemust carefully consider what value might mak etherational expression undefined and so
must be e xcluded.
When we solve an equation and the r esult is x=3,we kno w ther e is one solution, which is 3.
When wesolve aninequality and theresult isx>3,weknowther earemany solutions. Wegraph theresult tobetter
help showallthesolutions, and westart with 3.Threebecomes acritical point and then wedecide whether toshade to
the left or right of it. The numbers to the right of 3 ar e lar ger than 3, so we shade to the right.
To solve a r ational inequality, we first must write the inequality with only one quotient on the left and 0 on the right.
Nextwedetermine thecritical points touse todivide thenumber line into intervals. Acritical point isanumber which
mak e the r ational e xpression zer o or undefined.
Wethen will evaluate thefactors ofthenumer ator and denominator, and find thequotient ineach interval. This will
identify the interval, or intervals, that contains all the solutions of the r ational inequality.
We write the solution in interval notation being car eful to determine whether the endpoints ar e included.
EXAMPLE 7.54
Solve and write the solution in interval notation:x−1
x+3≥0.Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions 723Solution
Step 1. Write the inequality as one quotient on the left and zer o on the right.
Our inequality is in this form.x−1
x+3≥0
Step 2. Determine the critical points—the points wher e the r ational e xpression will be zer o or undefined.
The rational expression willbezerowhen thenumer ator iszero.Since x−1=0when x=1,then 1isacritical point.
The rational expression willbeundefined when thedenominator iszero.Since x+3=0when x=−3,then −3 isa
critical point.
The critical points ar e 1 and −3.
Step 3. Use the critical points to divide the number line into intervals.
The number line is divided into thr ee intervals:
(−∞,−3) (−3,1) (1,∞)
Step 4.Testavalue ineach interval. Abovethenumber lineshowthesign ofeach factor oftherational expression ineach
interval. Belo w the number line sho w the sign of the quotient.
Tofind thesign ofeach factor inaninterval, wechoose any point inthat interval and use itasatest point. Any point in
the interval will give the e xpression the same sign, so we can choose any point in the interval.
Interval⎛⎝−∞,−3⎞⎠
The number −4is in the interval (−∞,−3).Testx=−4in the e xpression in the numer ator and the denominator.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1negative and mark the factor x+3negative.
Since a negative divided b y a negative is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (−∞,−3).
Interval⎛⎝−3,1⎞⎠
The number 0 is in the interval (−3,1).Testx=0.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1negative and mark x+3positive.
Since a negative divided b y a positive is negative, the quotient is mark ed negative in the interval (−3,1).724 Chapter 7 Rational Expressions and Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Interval⎛⎝1,∞⎞⎠
The number 2 is in the interval (1,∞).Testx=2.
Above the number line, mark the factor x−1positive and mark x+3positive.
Since a positive divided b y a positive is positive, mark the quotient positive in the interval (1,∞).
Step 5. Determine the intervals wher e the inequality is corr ect. W rite the solution in interval notation.
Wewant thequotient tobegreater than orequal tozero,sothenumbers intheintervals (−∞,−3)and (1,∞)are
solutions.
But what about the critical points?
The critical point x=−3 mak esthedenominator 0,soitmust beexcluded fromthesolution and wemark itwith a
parenthesis.
The critical point x=1mak esthewhole rational expression 0.The inequality requir esthat therational expression be
greater than or equal to. So, 1 is part of the solution and we will mark it with a br acket.
Recall that when wehave asolution made upofmor ethan one interval weuse theunion symbol, ∪,toconnect the
two intervals. The solution in interval notation is (−∞,−3)∪[1,∞).

Simplify Expr essions with Roots
InFoundations ,webriefly look edatsquar eroots. Remember that when arealnumber nismultiplied byitself, wewrite
n2and r ead it ‘ nsquar ed’. This number is called the squar eofn, and nis called the squar e root. For e xample,
132is read “13 sq uared”
169 is called t hesquareof 13, since 132=169
13 is a square rootof 169
Square and Square Root of a number
Squar e
Ifn2=m,then mis thesquareofn.
Squar e Root
Ifn2=m,then nis asquare rootofm.
Notice (−13)2= 169 also, so −13 is also a squar e root of 169. Ther efore, both 13 and −13 ar e squar e roots of 169.
So,every positive number has two squar eroots—one positive and one negative. What ifweonly wanted thepositive
squar erootofapositive number? Weusearadical sign,and write, m,which denotes thepositive squar erootofm.The
positive squar e root is also called the principal squar e root.
Wealso usetheradical sign forthesquar erootofzero.Because 02=0, 0=0.Notice that zerohasonly one squar e
root.
Square Root Notation
mis read “t he sq uare root of m”.
Ifn2=m,then n=m,forn≥0.
Weknowthat every positive number has two squar eroots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. Wewrite
169 =13.Ifwewant tofind thenegative squar erootofanumber, weplace anegative infrontoftheradical sign. For
example, −169 =−13 .

Sofarwehave only talkedabout squar esand squar eroots. Let’s nowextend our work toinclude higher powers and
higher r oots.
Let’s r eview some vocabulary first.
We write: We say:
n2nsquared
n3ncubed
n4nto the fourth power
n5nto the fif th power
The terms ‘squar ed’ and ‘cubed’ come fr om the formulas for ar ea of a squar e and volume of a cube.
It will be helpful to have a table of the po wers of the integers fr om −5 to 5. See Figur e 8.2 .
Figur e 8.2
Notice thesigns inthetable. Allpowers ofpositive numbers arepositive, ofcourse. Butwhen wehave anegative number,
theeven powers arepositive and theodd powers arenegative. We’llcopytherowwith thepowers of−2tohelp you seeChapter 8 Roots and Radicals 747this.
We will no w extend the squar e root definition to higher r oots.

Ifbn=a,then bis an nthroot of a.
The pr incipal nthroot of ais wr itten an.

Just lik e we use the wor d ‘cubed’ for b3, we use the term ‘cube r oot’ for a3.

Estimate and Appr oximate Roots
When weseeanumber with aradical sign, weoften don’t think about itsnumerical value. While weprobably knowthat
the 4=2,what isthevalue of 21or 503?Insome situations aquick estimate ismeaningful and inothers itis
convenient to have a decimal appr oximation.

estimate of 11,wesee11isbetween perfect squar enumbers 9and 16,closer to9.Itssquar erootthen willbebetween

The odd r oot of a number can be either positive or negative. For e xample,
But what about an e ven r oot? W e want the principal r oot, so 6254=5.

Wewillsimplify radical expressions inaway similar tohowwesimplified fractions. Afraction issimplified ifther eare
nocommon factors inthenumer ator and denominator. Tosimplify afraction, welook forany common factors inthe
numer ator and denominator.
Aradical expression ,an,isconsider edsimplified ifithasnofactors ofmn.So,tosimplify aradical expression, welook
for any factors in the r adicand that ar e po wers of the inde x.
Simplified Radical Expression
For r eal numbers aand m, and n≥2,
anis consider ed sim plified if ahas no f actors of mn
Forexample, 5isconsider edsimplified because ther earenoperfect squar efactors in5.But 12isnot simplified
because 12 has a perfect squar e factor of 4.
Similarly, 43issimplified because ther earenoperfect cube factors in4.But 243isnot simplified because 24has a
perfect cube factor of 8.
Tosimplify radical expressions, wewillalso use some properties ofroots. The properties wewilluse tosimplify radical
expressions aresimilar tothe properties ofexponents. Weknowthat (ab)n=anbn.The corresponding ofProduct
Property of Roots says that abn=an·bn.
Product Property of nthRoots
Ifanand bnare real numbers, and n≥2is an integer, then
abn=an·bnand an·bn=abn
We use the Pr oduct Pr operty of Roots to r emo ve all perfect squar e factors fr om a squar e root.

Simplify Expr essions with a1n
Rational exponents areanother way ofwriting expressions with radicals. When weuse rational exponents, wecan apply
the pr operties of e xponents to simplify e xpressions.
The Power Property forExponents says that (am)n=am·nwhen mand narewhole numbers. Let’s assume wearenow
not limited to whole numbers.
Suppose wewant tofind anumber psuch that (8p)3=8.WewillusethePower Property ofExponents tofind thevalue
ofp.
(8p)3=8
Multipl y the exponents on t he lef t. 83p=8
Write the exponent 1 on t he right. 83p=81
Since t he bases ar e the same, t he exponents mus t be eq ual. 3p=1
Solve forp. p=1
3
So⎛
⎝⎜81
3⎞
⎠⎟3
=8.But we kno w also⎛
⎝83⎞
⎠3
=8.Then it must be that 81
3=83.
This same logic can be used for any positive integer e xponent nto sho w that a1n=an.
Rational Exponent a1n
Ifanis a r eal number and n≥2,then
a1n=an
The denominator of the r ational e xponent is the inde x of the r adical.
Ther ewillbetimes when working with expressions willbeeasier ifyou use rational exponents and times when itwillbe
easier if you use r adicals. In the first fe w examples, you’ll pr actice converting e xpressions between these two notations.776 Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals

Add and Subtr act Radical Expr essions
Adding radical expressions with thesame inde xand thesame radicand isjust likeadding liketerms. Wecallradicals with
the same inde x and the same r adicand like radicals to remind us the y work the same as lik e terms.
Like Radicals
Like radicals are radical e xpressions with the same inde x and the same r adicand.
Weadd and subtr actlikeradicals inthesame way weadd and subtr actliketerms. Weknowthat 3x+8xis11x.Similarly
we add 3x+8xand the r esult is 11x.
Think about adding liketerms with variables asyou dothenextfewexamples. When you have likeradicals, you just add
or subtr act the coefficients. When the r adicals ar e not lik e, you cannot combine the terms.
EXAMPLE 8.36

as long as all the variables and their e xponents ar e identical, the r adicands ar e the same.

Wehave used theProduct Property ofRoots tosimplify squar eroots byremo ving theperfect squar efactors. Wecanuse
theProduct Property ofRoots ‘inreverse’ tomultiply squar eroots. Remember, weassume allvariables aregreater than

For any r eal numbers, anand bn,and for any integer n≥2
abn=an·bnand an·bn=abn
When wemultiply two radicals theymust have thesame inde x.Once wemultiply theradicals, wethen look forfactors
that ar e a po wer of the inde x and simplify the r adical whene ver possible.
Multiplying radicals with coefficients ismuch likemultiplying variables with coefficients. Tomultiply 4x·3ywemultiply

Divide Radical Expr essions
Wehave used theQuotient Property ofRadical Expr essions tosimplify roots offractions. Wewillneed tousethis property
‘in reverse’ to simplify a fr action with r adicals.
Wegive theQuotient Property ofRadical Expr essions again foreasy reference. Remember, weassume allvariables are
greater than or equal to zer o so that no absolute value bars r e needed.

Wewilluse theQuotient Property ofRadical Expr essions when thefraction westart with isthequotient oftwo radicals,

Rationalize a One T erm Denominator
Befor ethe calculator became atool ofeveryday life, appr oximating the value ofafraction with aradical inthe
denominator was a very cumbersome pr ocess!
For this reason, aprocess called rationalizing the denominator was developed. Afraction with aradical inthe
denominator isconverted toanequivalent fraction whose denominator isaninteger. Squar eroots ofnumbers that are
notperfect squar esareirrational numbers. When werationalize thedenominator, wewrite anequivalent fraction with a804 Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5rational number in the denominator.
This pr ocess is still used today, and is useful in other ar eas of mathematics, too.
Rationalizing the Denominator
Rationalizing the denominator isthe process ofconverting afraction with aradical inthe denominator toan
equivalent fr action whose denominator is an integer.
Even though wehave calculators available nearly everywher e,afraction with aradical inthedenominator stillmust be
rationalized. It is not consider ed simplified if the denominator contains a r adical.
Similarly, a radical e xpression is not consider ed simplified if the r adicand contains a fr action.
Simplified Radical Expressions
A radical e xpression is consider ed simplified if ther e are
•no factors in the r adicand have perfect po wers of the inde x
•no fr actions in the r adicand
•no radicals in the denominator of a fr action
Torationalize adenominator with asquar eroot, weuse theproperty that (a)2=a.Ifwesquar eanirrational squar e
root, we get a r ational number.
We will use this pr operty to r ationalize the denominator in the ne xt example.

is called a radical equation .
Radical Equation
An equation in which a variable is in the r adicand of a r adical e xpression is called a radical equation .
Asusual, when solving these equations, what wedotoone side ofanequation wemust dototheother side aswell. Once
weisolate theradical, ourstrategy willbetoraise both sides oftheequation tothepower oftheinde x.This willeliminate
the r adical.
Solving radical equations containing aneven inde xbyraising both sides tothepower oftheinde xmay introduce an

odd inde x, the r adicand can be any r eal number. W e restate the pr operties her e for r eference.
Properties of an
When nis an even number and:
•a≥0,then anis a r eal number.
•a<0,then anis not a r eal number.
When nis an odd number, anis a r eal number for all values of a.
So,tofind thedomain ofaradical function with even inde x,wesettheradicand tobegreater than orequal tozero.For
an odd inde x radical, the r adicand can be any r eal number.
Domain of a Radical Function
When the inde xof the r adical is even, the r adicand must be gr eater than or equal to zer o.
When the inde xof the r adical is odd, the r adicand can be any r eal number.

Graph Radical Functions
Befor ewegraph any radical function, wefirst find thedomain ofthefunction. Forthefunction, f(x)=x,theinde xis
even, and so the r adicand must be gr eater than or equal to 0.
This tells us the domain is x≥0and we write this in interval notation as [0,∞).
Previously weused point plotting tograph thefunction, f(x)=x.Wechose x-values, substituted them inand then
created a chart. Notice we chose points that ar e perfect squar es in or der to mak e taking the squar e root easier.Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals 831Once weseethegraph, wecan find therange ofthefunction. The y-values ofthefunction aregreater than orequal to
zero. The r ange then is [0,∞).

Evaluate the Squar e Root of a Negative Number
Whene verwehave asituation wher ewehave asquar erootofanegative number wesayther eisnorealnumber that
equals that squar eroot. Forexample, tosimplify −1,wearelooking forarealnumber xsothat x2=–1.Since allreal
numbers squar ed ar e positive numbers, ther e is no r eal number that equals –1 when squar ed.
Mathematicians have often expanded their numbers systems asneeded. Theyadded 0tothecounting numbers toget
thewhole numbers. When theyneeded negative balances, theyadded negative numbers togettheintegers. When they
needed theidea ofparts ofawhole theyadded fractions and gottherational numbers. Adding theirrational numbers
allowed numbers like5.Allofthese together gave ustherealnumbers and sofarinyour study ofmathematics, that
has been sufficient.
But nowwewill expand therealnumbers toinclude thesquar eroots ofnegative numbers. Westart bydefining the
imaginary unit ias the number whose squar e is –1.

Nowthat wearefamiliar with theimaginary number i,wecan expand therealnumbers toinclude imaginary numbers.
The comple xnumber system includes therealnumbers and theimaginary numbers. Acomple xnumber isoftheform
a+bi, wher ea, bare real numbers. W e call athe r eal part and bthe imaginary part.
Complex Number
Acomple x number is of the form a+bi, wher eaand bare real numbers.
A comple x number is in standar d form when written as a+bi,wher eaand bare real numbers.
Ifb=0,then a+bibecomes a+0·i=a,and is a r eal number.
Ifb≠0,then a+biis an imaginary number.
Ifa=0,then a+bibecomes 0+bi=bi,and is called a pur e imaginary number.
We summarize this her e.Chapter 8 Roots and Radicals 837a+bi

Wehave seen that some quadr aticequations canbesolved byfactoring. Inthischapter, wewilllearn threeother methods
to use in case a quadr atic equation cannot be factor ed.
Solve Quadr atic Equations of the form ax2=kusing the Squar e Root Pr operty
Wehave already solved some quadr aticequations byfactoring. Let’s reviewhowweused factoring tosolve thequadr atic
equation x2= 9.
Put the eq uation in s tandar d form.
Factor the differ ence of sq uares.x2=9
x2−9=0
(x−3)(x+3)=0
Use t he Zer o Product Pr operty.
Solve eac h equation.x−3=0 x−3=0
x=3 x=−3
Wecaneasily usefactoring tofind thesolutions ofsimilar equations, likex2=16and x2=25,because 16and 25areperfect
squar es. In each case, we would get two solutions, x=4,x=−4and x=5,x=−5.
Butwhat happens when wehave anequation likex2=7?Since 7isnotaperfect squar e,wecannot solve theequation by
factoring.
Previously welearned that since 169isthesquar eof13,wecanalso saythat 13isasquar erootof169. Also, (−13)2=169,
so−13isalso asquar erootof169. Ther efore,both 13and −13aresquar eroots of169. So,every positive number hastwo
squar e roots—one positive and one negative. W e earlier defined the squar e root of a number in this way:
Ifn2=m,then nis a sq uare root of m.
Since these equations arealloftheform x2=k,thesquar erootdefinition tells usthesolutions arethetwo squar eroots
ofk. This leads to the Squar e Root Pr operty .
Square Root Property
Ifx2=k, then
x=kor x=−kor x=±k.
Notice that theSquar eRoot Property gives two solutions toanequation oftheform x2=k,theprincipal squar erootofk
and itsopposite. Wecould also write thesolution asx=±k.Weread this asxequals positive ornegative thesquar e
root of k.
Now we will solve the equation x2= 9 again, this time using the Squar e Root Pr operty.
Use t he Sq uare Root Property.x2=9
x=±9
x=±3
Sox=3orx=−3.
What happens when theconstant isnotaperfect squar e?Let’s usetheSquar eRoot Property tosolve theequation x2=7.
x2=7
Use t he Sq uare Root Property. x=7, x=−7
We cannot simplify 7, so we leave the answer as a r adical.

Ifaand bare real numbers,874 Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5We can use this pattern to “mak e” a perfect squar e.
Wewillstart with theexpression x2+6x.Since ther eisaplus sign between thetwo terms, wewillusethe(a+b)2pattern,
a2+ 2ab+b2= (a+b)2.
Weultimately need tofind thelast term ofthis trinomial that willmak eitaperfect squar etrinomial. Todothat wewill
need tofind b.Butfirst westart with determining a.Notice that thefirst term ofx2+6xisasquar e,x2.This tells usthat a
=x.
What number, b,when multiplied with 2 xgives 6 x? It would have to be 3, which is1
2(6).Sob= 3.
Now to complete the perfect squar e trinomial, we will find the last term b y squaring b, which is 32= 9.
We can no w factor.
So we found that adding 9 to x2+ 6x‘completes the squar e’, and we write it as ( x+ 3)2.

Solve Equations in Quadr atic Form
Sometimes when wefactor edtrinomials, thetrinomial didnotappear tobeintheax2+bx+cform. Sowefactor edby

Tofactor theexpression x4−4x2−5,wenoticed thevariable part ofthemiddle term isx2and itssquar e,x4,isthevariable
part of the first term. (W e kno w⎛

Letu=x2and substitute.
Factor the trinomial.
Replace uwith x2.
Similarly, sometimes anequation isnotintheax2+bx+c=0form butlooks much likeaquadr aticequation. Then, wecan
often mak eathoughtful substitution that willallowustomak eitfittheax2+bx+c=0form. Ifwecanmak eitfittheform,
we can then use all of our methods to solve quadr atic equations.
Notice that inthequadr atic equation ax2+bx+c=0,themiddle term has avariable, x,and itssquar e,x2,isthevariable
part of the first term. Look for this r elationship as you try to find a substitution.
Again, wewilluse thestandar dutomak easubstitution that willputtheequation inquadr atic form. Ifthesubstitution
gives us an equation of the form ax2+bx+c= 0, we say the original equation was of quadr atic form .

We will use the formula for the ar ea of a triangle to solve the ne xt example.
Area of a Triangle
For a triangle with base, b, and height, h, the ar ea,A, is given b y the formula A=1

This is a uniform motion situation. A diagr am will help us visualize the situation.Chapter 9 Quadratic Equations and Functions 917We fill in the chart to or ganize the information.
We are looking f or the speed of t he je t stream. Letr=the speed of t he je t stream.
When the plane flies with the wind, the wind incr eases its speed and so the r ate is 450 + r.
When the plane flies against the wind, the wind decr eases its speed and the r ate is 450 − r.
Write in the r ates.
Write in the distances.
Since D=r·t, we solve for

Find the Inter cepts of a Par abola
When wegraphed linear equations, weoften used the x-and y-inter cepts tohelp usgraph the lines. Finding the
coor dinates of the inter cepts will help us to gr aph par abolas, too.
Remember, at the y-inter cept the value of xis zer o. So to find the y-inter cept, we substitute x= 0 into the function.

The last example showsusthat tograph aquadr atic function oftheform f(x)=x2+k,wetakethebasic parabola

This transformation is called a vertical shift.

Find and Evaluate Composite Functions
Befor eweintroduce thefunctions, weneed tolook atanother oper ation onfunctions called composition .Incomposition,
theoutput ofone function istheinput ofasecond function. Forfunctions fand g,thecomposition iswritten f∘g
and is defined b y⎛⎝f∘g⎞⎠(x)=f⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠.
We read f⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠as“fofgofx.”
Todoacomposition, theoutput ofthefirst function, g(x),becomes theinput ofthesecond function, f,and sowemust
be sur e that it is part of the domain of f.
Composition of Functions
The composition of functions fand gis written f·gand is defined b y
⎛⎝f∘g⎞⎠(x)=f⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠
We read f⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠asfofgofx.
Wehave actually used composition without using thenotation many times befor e.When wegraphed quadr aticfunctions
using translations, wewerecomposing functions. Forexample, ifwefirst graphed g(x)=x2asaparabola and then
shifted it do wn vertically four units, we wer e using the composition defined b y⎛⎝f∘g⎞⎠(x)=f⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠wher ef(x)=x−4.

Determine Whether a Function is One-to-One
When wefirst introduced functions, wesaid afunction isarelation that assigns toeach element initsdomain exactly one
element in the r ange. For each or dered pair in the r elation, each x-value is matched with only one y-value.
Weused thebirthday example tohelp usunderstand thedefinition. Every person has abirthday, but noone has two
birthdays and itisokay fortwo people toshar eabirthday. Since each person has exactly one birthday, that relation isa
function.
Afunction isone-to-one ifeach value intherange has exactly one element inthedomain. Foreach orderedpair inthe
function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value.
Our example ofthebirthday relation isnotaone-to-one function. Twopeople can shar ethesame birthday. The range

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5not one-to-one.
One-to-One Function
Afunction isone-to-one ifeach value intherange corresponds toone element inthedomain. Foreach orderedpair
in the function, each y-value is matched with only one x-value. Ther e are no r epeated y-values.
EXAMPLE 10.3
For each set of or dered pairs, determine if it r epresents a function and, if so, if the function is one-to-one.
ⓐ{(−3,27),(−2,8),(−1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,8),(3,27)}and ⓑ{(0,0),(1,1),(4,2),(9,3),(16,4)}.
Solution
ⓐ
{(−3,27),(−2,8),(−1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,8),(3,27)}
Each x-value is matched with only one y-value. So this r elation is a function.
Buteach y-value isnotpairedwith only one x-value, (−3,27)and (3,27),forexample. Sothis function isnotone-to-
one.
ⓑ
{(0,0),(1,1),(4,2),(9,3),(16,4)}
Each x-value is matched with only one y-value. So this r elation is a function.
Since each y-value is pair ed with only one x-value, this function is one-to-one.
TRY IT : : 10.5
For each set of or dered pairs, determine if it r epresents a function and if so, is the function one-to-one.
ⓐ{(−3,−6),(−2,−4),(−1,−2),(0,0),(1,2),(2,4),(3,6)}
ⓑ{(−4,8),(−2,4),(−1,2),(0,0),(1,2),(2,4),(4,8)}
TRY IT : : 10.6

ⓑ{(7,−3),(−5,−4),(8,0),(0,0),(−6,4),(−2,2),(−1,3)}
Tohelp usdetermine whether arelation isafunction, weuse the vertical line test.Asetofpoints inarectangular
coor dinate system isthegraph ofafunction ifevery vertical line intersects thegraph inatmost one point. Also, ifany
vertical line intersects the gr aph in mor e than one point, the gr aph does not r epresent a function.
The vertical line isrepresenting anx-value and wecheck that itintersects the graph inonly one y-value. Then itisa
function.
Tocheck ifafunction isone-to-one, weuseasimilar process. Weuseahorizontal line and check that each horizontal line
intersects thegraph inonly one point. The horizontal line isrepresenting ay-value and wecheck that itintersects the
graph inonly one x-value. Ifevery horizontal line intersects thegraph ofafunction inatmost one point, itisaone-to-one
function. This is the horizontal line test .
Horizontal Line Test
If every horizontal line intersects the gr aph of a function in at most one point, it is a one-to-one function.
Wecan test whether agraph ofarelation isafunction byusing thevertical line test. Wecan then tellifthefunction is
one-to-one b y applying the horizontal line test.
EXAMPLE 10.4Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 995Determine ⓐwhether each gr aph is the gr aph of a function and, if so, ⓑwhether it is one-to-one.
Solution
ⓐ
Since any vertical line intersects thegraph inatmost one point, thegraph isthegraph ofafunction. Since any horizontal
line intersects the gr aph in at most one point, the gr aph is the gr aph of a one-to-one function.
ⓑ
Since any vertical line intersects thegraph inatmost one point, thegraph isthegraph ofafunction. The horizontal line
shown on the gr aph intersects it in two points. This gr aph does not r epresent a one-to-one function.996 Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Find the Inverse of a Function
Let’s look ataone-to one function, f,represented bytheorderedpairs {(0,5),(1,6),(2,7),(3,8)}.Foreach x
-value, fadds 5togetthe y-value. To‘undo’ theaddition of5,wesubtr act5fromeach y-value and getback tothe
original x-value. W e can call this “taking the inverse of f” and name the function f−1.Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 997Notice that that theorderedpairs offand f−1have their x-values and y-values reversed. The domain offisthe
range of f−1and the domain of f−1is the r ange of f.
Inverse of a Function Defined by Ordered Pairs
Iff(x)isaone-to-one function whose orderedpairs areoftheform (x,y),then itsinverse function f−1(x)isthe
set of or dered pairs (y,x).
In the ne xt example we will find the inverse of a function defined b y ordered pairs.
EXAMPLE 10.5
Find theinverse ofthefunction {(0,3),(1,5),(2,7),(3,9)}.Determine thedomain and range oftheinverse function.
Solution
This function is one-to-one since e very x-value is pair ed with e xactly one y-value.
To find the inverse we r everse the x-values and y-values in the or dered pairs of the function.

Wejust noted that iff(x)isaone-to-one function whose orderedpairs areoftheform (x,y),then itsinverse function
f−1(x)is the set of or dered pairs (y,x).
Soifapoint (a,b)isonthegraph ofafunction f(x),then theorderedpair (b,a)isonthegraph off−1(x).See

EXAMPLE 10.6
Graph, on the same coor dinate system, the inverse of the one-to one function sho wn.
Solution
Wecan use points on the graph tofind points on the inverse graph. Some points on the graph are:
(−5,−3),(−3,−1),(−1,0),(0,2),(3,4).
So, the inverse function will contain the points: (−3,−5),(−1,−3),(0,−1),(2,0),(4,3).

Graph Exponential Functions
The functions wehave studied sofardonotgive usamodel formany natur allyoccurring phenomena. Fromthegrowth
ofpopulations and thespread ofviruses toradioactive decay and compounding inter est, themodels arevery differ ent
from what we have studied so far. These models involve e xponential functions.
Anexponential function is a function of the form f(x)=axwher ea>0and a≠1.
Exponential Function
An e xponential function, wher ea>0and a≠1,is a function of the form
f(x)=ax
Notice that in this function, the variable is the e xponent. In our functions so far, the variables wer e the base.
Our definition says a≠1.Ifweleta=1,then f(x)=axbecomes f(x)=1x.Since 1x=1forallrealnumbers,
f(x)=1.This is the constant function.
Our definition also says a>0.Ifweletabase benegative, say −4,then f(x)=(−4)xisnotarealnumber when
x=1

shape. This is the shape we e xpect fr om an e xponential function wher ea>1.
We notice, that for each function, the gr aph contains the point (0,1).This mak e sense because a0=1for any a.
The graph ofeach function, f(x)=axalso contains thepoint (1,a).The graph off(x)=2xcontained (1,2)and the

allhave thesame

We notice that for each function, the gr aph still contains the point (0, 1). This mak e sense because a0=1for any a.

Itisimportant forustonotice that both ofthese graphs areone-to-one, astheyboth pass thehorizontal line test. This
means the e xponential function will have an inverse. W e will look at this later.
When wegraphed quadr atic functions, wewereable tograph using translation rather than just plotting points. Will that
work in gr aphing e xponential functions?
EXAMPLE 10.12
On the same coor dinate system gr aph f(x)=2xand g(x)=2x+1.
Solution
We will use point plotting to gr aph the functions.1012 Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

Looking atthegraphs ofthefunctions f(x)=2xand g(x)=2x+1inthelast example, weseethat adding one inthe
exponent caused ahorizontal shift ofone unit totheleft. Recognizing this pattern allowsustograph other functions with
the same pattern b y translation.
Let’s no w consider another situation that might be gr aphed mor e easily b y translation, once we r ecognize the pattern.
EXAMPLE 10.13

Looking atthegraphs ofthefunctions f(x)=3xand g(x)=3x−2inthelast example, wesee that subtr acting 2

Use the Pr operties of Logarithms
Nowthat wehave learned about exponential and logarithmic functions, wecan introduce some ofthe properties of
logarithms. These will be very helpful as we continue to solve both e xponential and logarithmic equations.
The first two properties derive fromthedefinition oflogarithms. Since a0=1,wecanconvert this tologarithmic form
and get loga1=0.Also, since a1=a,we get logaa=1.
Properties of Logarithms
loga1=0 logaa=1
Inthenextexample wecould evaluate thelogarithm byconverting toexponential form, aswehave done previously, but
recognizing and then applying the pr operties saves time.

The nexttwo properties can also beverified byconverting them from exponential form tologarithmic form, orthe
reverse.
The exponential equation alogax=xconverts tothelogarithmic equation logax=logax,which isatrue statement1038 Chapter 10 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5for positive values for xonly.
The logarithmic equation logaax=xconverts to the e xponential equation ax=ax,which is also a true statement.
These two properties arecalled inverse properties because, when wehave thesame base, raising toapower “undoes” the
logand taking thelog“undoes” raising toapower. These two properties showthecomposition offunctions. Both ended
up with the identity function which sho ws again that the e xponential and logarithmic functions ar e inverse functions.
Inverse Properties of Logarithms
For a>0,x>0and a≠1,
alogax=x logaax=x
In the ne xt example, apply the inverse pr operties of logarithms.

Product Property of Logarithms
IfM>0,N>0,a>0and a≠1,then,
loga(M·N)=logaM+logaN
The logarithm of a pr oduct is the sum of the logarithms.
We use this pr operty to write the log of a pr oduct as a sum of the logs of each factor.

Quotient Property of Logarithms
IfM>0,N>0,a>0and a≠1,then,
logaM
N=logaM−logaN
The logarithm of a quotient is the differ ence of the logarithms.
Note that logaM−logaN≠loga(M−N).
We use this pr operty to write the log of a quotient as a differ ence of the logs of each factor.

Wehave seen that growth and decay aremodeled byexponential functions. Forgrowth and decay weuse theformula
A=A0ekt.Exponential growth has apositive rateofgrowth orgrowth constant, k,and exponential decay has a
negative r ate of gr owth or decay constant, k.
Exponential Growth and Decay
For an original amount, A0,that gr ows or decays at a r ate, k, for a certain time, t, the final amount, A, is:

CONICS 11Chapter 11 Conics 1071that result fromaplane intersecting adouble cone—two cones placed point-to-point. Each half ofadouble cone iscalled
a nappe.
Ther earefour conics—the circle,parabola ,ellipse ,and hyperbola .The nextfigur eshowshowtheplane intersecting the
double cone r esults in each curve.
Each ofthecurves has many applications that affect your daily life, fromyour cell phone toacoustics and navigation
systems. In this section we will look at the pr operties of a cir cle.
Use the Distance Formula
Wehave used thePythagor ean Theor emtofind thelengths ofthesides ofaright triangle. Herewewillusethis theor em
again tofind distances ontherectangular coor dinate system. Byfinding distance ontherectangular coor dinate system,
wecan mak eaconnection between thegeometry ofaconic and algebr a—which opens upaworld ofopportunities for
application.
Our first step istodevelop aformula tofind distances between points ontherectangular coor dinate system. Wewillplot
thepoints and create aright triangle much aswedidwhen wefound slope inGraphs and Functions .Wethen takeitone
step further and usethePythagor ean Theor emtofind thelength ofthehypotenuse ofthetriangle—which isthedistance
between the points.
EXAMPLE 11.1
Use the r ectangular coor dinate system to find the distance between the points (6,4)and (2,1).
Solution
Plot the two points. Connect the two points
with a line.
Draw a right triangle as if you wer e going to
find slope.
Find the length of each leg.
Use the Pythagor ean Theor em to find d, the
distance between the two points.a2+b2=c2
Substitute in the values. 32+42=d21072 Chapter 11 Conics

25=d2
Use the Squar e Root Pr operty. d=5 d=−5
Since distance, dis positive, we can eliminate
d=−5.The distance between the points (6,4)and
(2,1)is 5.
TRY IT : : 11.1
Use the r ectangular coor dinate system to find the distance between the points (6,1)and (2,−2).
TRY IT : : 11.2
Use the r ectangular coor dinate system to find the distance between the points (5,3)and (−3,−3).
The method weused inthelast example leads ustotheformula tofind thedistance between thetwo points (x1,y1)
and (x2,y2).
When we found the length of the horizontal leg we subtr acted 6−2which is x2−x1.
When we found the length of the vertical leg we subtr acted 4−1which is y2−y1.
Ifthetriangle had been inadiffer entposition, wemay have subtr acted x1−x2ory1−y2.The expressions x2−x1
and x1−x2vary only inthesign oftheresulting number. Togetthepositive value-since distance ispositive- wecanuse
absolute value. So to gener alize we will say |x2−x1|and|y2−y1|.
In the Pythagor ean Theor em, we substitute the gener al expressions |x2−x1|and|y2−y1|rather than the numbers.

Use t he Sq uare Root Property. d=±(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2
Distance is positiv e, so eliminate t he neg ative
value.d= (x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2
This is the Distance Formula we use to find the distance dbetween the two points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2).Chapter 11 Conics 1073Distance Formula
The distance dbetween the two points (x1,y1)and (x2,y2)is
d=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2
EXAMPLE 11.2

Itisoften useful tobeable tofind themidpoint ofasegment. Forexample, ifyou have theendpoints ofthediameter of

The r adius is the distance fr om the center, (h,k),to a
point on the cir cle, (x,y).
To derive the equation of a cir cle, we can use the
distance formula with the points (h,k),(x,y)and the
distance, r.d=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2
Substitute the values.r=(x−h)2+⎛⎝y−k⎞⎠2

origin of the coor dinate grid at the point
(0,0).
Since the base is 20 feet wide the point
(20,0)represents the lo wer right side.
The bridge is 10 feet high at the highest
point. The highest point is the verte x of
the par abola so the y-coor dinate of the
verte x will be 10.
Since the bridge is symmetric, the verte x
must fall halfway between the left most
point, (0,0),and the rightmost point
(20,0).From this we kno w that the
x-coor dinate of the verte x will also be 10.

Ellipse
Anellipse isallpoints inaplane wher ethesum ofthedistances fromtwo fixedpoints isconstant. Each ofthefixed
points is called a focus of the ellipse.
Wecandrawanellipse bytaking some fixedlength offlexible string and attaching theends totwo thumbtacks. Weusea
pen to pull the string taut and r otate it ar ound the two thumbtacks. The figur e that r esults is an ellipse.
Aline drawn through thefoci intersect theellipse intwo points. Each point iscalled averte xoftheellipse. The segment
connecting thevertices iscalled themajor axis .The midpoint ofthesegment iscalled thecenter oftheellipse. Asegment
perpendicular tothemajor axis that passes through thecenter and intersects theellipse intwo points iscalled theminor
axis .Chapter 11 Conics 1107Wementioned earlier that ourgoal istoconnect thegeometry ofaconic with algebr a.Placing theellipse onarectangular

The x-inter cepts are(a,0)and (−a,0). Ther e are no y-inter cepts.
The a,bvalues intheequation also help usfind theasymptotes ofthehyperbola. The asymptotes areintersecting straight
lines that the br anches of the gr aph appr oach but ne ver intersect as the x,yvalues get lar ger and lar ger.Chapter 11 Conics 1125Tofind the asymptotes, wesketch arectangle whose sides intersect the x-axis atthe vertices (−a,0),(a,0)and
intersect they-axis at(0,−b),(0,b).The lines containing thediagonals ofthis rectangle aretheasymptotes ofthe
hyperbola. The r ectangle and asymptotes ar e not part of the hyperbola, but the y help us gr aph the hyperbola.
The asymptotes pass through theorigin and wecan evaluate their slope using therectangle wesketched. Theyhave
equations y=b

Ther earetwo equations forhyperbolas, depending whether the transverse axis isvertical orhorizontal. Wecan tell
whether thetransverse axis ishorizontal bylooking attheequation. When theequation isinstandar dform, ifthex2-term
ispositive, thetransverse axis ishorizontal. When theequation isinstandar dform, ifthey2-term ispositive, thetransverse
axis is vertical.
The second equations could be derived similarly to what we have done. W e will summarize the r esults her e.

When westudied systems oflinear equations, weused themethod ofelimination tosolve thesystem. Wecan also use
elimination tosolve systems ofnonlinear equations. Itworks well when theequations have both variables squar ed.When
using elimination, wetrytomak ethecoefficients ofone variable tobeopposites, sowhen weadd theequations together,
that variable is eliminated.
The elimination method isvery similar totheelimination method that weused forsystems oflinear equations. The steps
are listed for r eference.

Sequences
Asequence is a function whose domain is the counting numbers.
Asequence canalso beseen asanorderedlistofnumbers and each number inthelistisaterm .Asequence may have an
infinite number ofterms orafinite number ofterms. Our sequence hasthreedots (ellipsis) attheend which indicates the

Often when working with sequences wedonotwant towrite outalltheterms. Wewant mor ecompact way toshowhow
each term isdefined. When wework edwith functions, wewrote f(x)=2xand wesaid theexpression 2xwas therule
that defined values intherange. While asequence isafunction, wedonotuse theusual function notation. Instead of
writing thefunction asf(x)=2x,wewould write itasan=2n.The anisthenthterm ofthesequence, theterm

gener al term or formula of the sequence.
General Term of a Sequence
The gener alterm ofthesequence isfound fromtheformula forwriting thenthterm ofthesequence. The nthterm
of the sequence, an, is the term in the nth position wher enis a value in the domain.

called factorial notation .Forexample, 5!,read 5factorial, means 5·4·3·2·1.The exclamation point isnotpunctuation

Find the Partial Sum
Sometimes inapplications, rather than just listtheterms, itisimportant forustoadd theterms ofasequence. Rather
than just connect the terms with plus signs, we can use summation notation .
Forexample, a1+a2+a3+a4+a5canbewritten as∑
i=15
ai.Weread this as“the sum ofasub ifromiequals one to
five.” The symbol ∑ means toadd and theiistheinde xofsummation. The 1tells uswher etostart (initial value) and
the 5 tells us wher e to end (terminal value).
Summation Notation
The sum of the first nterms of a sequence whose nth term is anis written in summation notation as:
∑
i=1n
ai=a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+…+an
The iis the inde x of summation and the 1 tells us wher e to start and the ntells us wher e to end.
When we add a finite number of terms, we call the sum a partial sum .

Determine if a Sequence is Arithmetic
The last section introduced sequences and nowwewilllook attwo specific types ofsequences that each have special
properties. In this section we will look at arithmetic sequences and in the ne xt section, geometric sequences.
Anarithmetic sequence isasequence wher ethe differ ence between consecutive terms isconstant. The differ ence
between consecutive terms inanarithmetic sequence, an−an−1,isd,thecommon differ ence ,forngreater than or
equal to two.
Arithmetic Sequence
Anarithmetic sequence is a sequence wher e the differ ence between consecutive terms is always the same.
The differ ence between consecutive terms, an−an−1,isd,thecommon differ ence ,forngreater than orequal to
two.
In each of these sequences, the differ ence between consecutive terms is constant, and so the sequence is arithmetic.
EXAMPLE 12.13

arithmetic sequence.
Let’s write thefirst fewterms ofasequence wher ethefirst term isa1and thecommon differ ence isd.Wewillthen look
for a pattern.
As we look for a pattern we see that each term starts with a1.
The first term adds 0dtothe a1,thesecond term adds 1d,thethirdterm adds 2d,thefourth term adds 3d,and thefifth
term adds 4d.The number ofdsthat wereadded toa1isone less than thenumber oftheterm. This leads ustothe

Find the Sum of the First nTerms of an Arithmetic Sequence
Aswith thegener alsequences, itisoften useful tofind thesum ofanarithmetic sequence. The sum, Sn,ofthefirst n
terms ofany arithmetic sequence iswritten asSn=a1+a2+a3+...+an.Tofind thesum bymerelyadding allthe
terms canbetedious. Sowecanalso develop aformula tofind thesum ofasequence using thefirst and lastterm ofthe
sequence.
Wecandevelop this newformula byfirst writing thesum bystarting with thefirst term, a1,and keep adding adtoget
the ne xt term as:
Sn=a1+(a1+d)+(a1+2d)+…+an.
Wecanalso reverse theorderoftheterms and write thesum bystarting with anand keep subtr acting dtogetthenext

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Sn=an+(an–d)+(an–2d)+…+a1.
Ifweadd these two expressions forthesum ofthefirst nterms ofanarithmetic sequence, wecan derive aformula for
the sum of the first nterms of any arithmetic series.
Sn=a1+(a1+d)+(a1+2d)+ … +an
+Sn=an +(an−d)+(an−2d)+ … +a1 _________________________________________________________
2Sn=(a1+an)+(a1+an)+(a1+an)+ … +(a1+an)
Because ther e arensums of (a1+an)on the right side of the equation, we r ewrite the right side as n(a1+an).
2Sn=n(a1+an)
We divide b y two to solve for Sn.
Sn=n

This give us a gener al formula for the sum of the first nterms of an arithmetic sequence.

Determine if a Sequence is Geometric
We are no w ready to look at the second special type of sequence, the geometric sequence.
Asequence iscalled ageometric sequence iftheratio between consecutive terms isalways thesame. The ratio between
consecutive terms in a geometric sequence is r, the common r atio , wher enis gr eater than or equal to two.

As we look for a pattern in the five terms abo ve, we see that each of the terms starts with a1.
The first term, a1,isnotmultiplied byany r.Inthesecond term, the a1ismultiplied byr.Inthethirdterm, the a1is

Apply Geometric Sequences and Series in the Real W orld
One application ofgeometric sequences has todowith consumer spending. Ifataxrebate isgiven toeach household,
the effect on the economy is many times the amount of the individual r ebate.
EXAMPLE 12.29
The government has decided togive a$1,000 taxrebate toeach household inorder tostimulate the economy. The
government statistics saythat each household willspend 80% oftherebate ingoods and services. The businesses and
individuals who benefitted fromthat 80% willthen spend 80% ofwhat theyreceived and soon.The result iscalled the
multiplier effect. What is the total effect of the r ebate on the economy?
Solution
Every time mone ygoes into theeconomy, 80% ofitisspent and isthen intheeconomy tobespent. Again, 80% ofthis
mone y is spent in the economy again. This situation continues and so leads us to an infinite geometric series.
1000 +1000 (0.8)+1000 (0.8)2+…
Herethefirst term is1,000, a1=1000 .The common ratio is0.8,r=0.8.Wecan evaluate this sum since 0.8<1.

also say that we e xpanded (a+b)2.
(a+b)2=a2+2ab+b2
To expand (a+b)3,we r ecognize that this is (a+b)2(a+b)and multiply.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12119/1.5Notice thefirst and lastterms showonly one variable. Recall that a0=1,sowecould rewrite thefirst and lastterms to
include both variables. For e xample, we could e xpand (a+b)3to sho w each term with both variables.
Gener ally, we don’t sho w the zer o exponents, just as we usually write xrather than 1 x.
Patterns in the expansion of (a+b)n
•The number of terms is n+1.
•The first term is anand the last term is bn.
•The e xponents on adecr ease b y one on each term going left to right.
•The e xponents on bincrease b y one on each term going left to right.
•The sum of the e xponents on any term is n.
Let’s look at an e xample to highlight the last thr ee patterns.
From the patterns we identified, we see the variables in the e xpansion of (a+b)n,would be
(a+b)n=an+___an−1b1+___an−2b2+...+___a1bn−1+bn.
Tofind the coefficients ofthe terms, wewrite our expansions again focusing onthe coefficients. Werewrite the
coefficients to the right forming an arr ay of coefficients.
The arraytotheright iscalled Pascal’s Triangle .Notice each number inthearrayisthesum ofthetwo closest numbers
in the r ow abo ve. W e can find the ne xt row by starting and ending with one and then adding two adjacent numbers.
This triangle gives the coefficients of the terms when we e xpand binomials.Chapter 12 Sequences, Series and Binomial Theorem 1205Pascal’s Triangle
In the ne xt example, we will use this triangle and the patterns we r ecognized to e xpand the binomial.
